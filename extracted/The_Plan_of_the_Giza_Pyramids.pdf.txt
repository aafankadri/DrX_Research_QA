The Plan of the Giza Pyramids 
by John A.R. Legon 
Revision Date:   22-11-2019 
My initial findings on the Giza Site Plan of Three Pyramids were first briefly summarized in a 
pamphlet  published by the Archaeology Society of Staten Island in 1979.1  Subsequently, I 
described the most significant features of the integrated site plan in several articles in the journals 
Discussions in Egyptology2 and Göttinger Miszellen.3  Further research has shown that many 
more factors must be taken into account, without alterating the basic framework of the dimensions 
in royal cubits which I described in 1979. The following text is  based on my article in Discussions 
in Egyptology Vol. 10, but now includes much new material and new illustrations.  In addition, 
acount has been taken of the extensive survey work carried out since 2012 by the late Glen Dash, 
and the positions of the corners of the three pyramids have been placed in the coordinate system 
initiated by Mark Lehner and David Goodman for the Giza Plateau Mapping Project. 
Now that a detailed topographical study of the Giza Plateau is in progress, 4 it is interesting to 
consider the results of the excavations and survey carried out by Flinders Petrie in 1880-2, when 
the exact dimensions and relative positions of the pyramids of Khufu, Khaefre and Menkaure, 
were established by triangulation..5 With reference to Petrie's survey-data, the present paper 
reviews the evidence first put forward by the writer in 1979, 6 showing that the sizes and relative 
positions of the three pyramids were determined by a single unifying ground plan.

The existence of a dimensional scheme underlying the placing of the three pyramids is suggested 
in the first instance by the very regular arrangement of these pyramids on the Giza plateau. As a 
result, the sides of the bases and the distances that separate them define consecutive axial distances 
from north to south and from east to west. The three pyramids were accurately aligned with respect 
to the four cardinal points, and were displaced from one another in a configuration which satisfies 
the requirements of a coherent dimensional design. Certain technical difficulties relating to the site 
chosen for each pyramid in turn also suggest that there must have been some significant constraint, 
in addition to factors such as ease of construction or the selection of the most favourable 
architectural setting, which determined where each of the three pyramids was positioned. 
 
Using some of the finest surveying equipment available in his day, Petrie asserted that he had fixed 
the positions of the main stations in his triangulation to within 3 mm.7 The accuracy of his work is 
proven by the fact that his result for the mean side-length of the Great Pyramid differs from the 
value obtained in the meticulous survey carried out by J.H. Cole in 1925,8 by only 1.5 cm,  even 
though nearly all of the outer casing of the pyramid is missing. Whereas Petrie had located single 
points of the casing in pits near the centre of each side, excavations in preparation for the work by 
Cole showed that substantial traces of the original casing-edge still remained on the pavement in 
some places where the casing itself has been destroyed.

The dimensions of the three pyramid-bases as determined by Petrie are given in Table I, together 
with the average variations in the lengths of the sides and the orientations of the three pyramids 
with respect to true north. The distances separating the centres of the pyramids were computed 
by Petrie along axes constructed parallel to the mean azimuth of the Second and Great Pyramids 
of -4' 52",9 and are given in Table II.

To obtain the axial components of spacing between the bases of the three pyramids, the distances 
between the pyramid-centres can be combined with the sides of the bases, to give the dimensions 
as listed in Table III. There will be small differences at the corners due to slight variations in the 
azimuths of the sides with respect to the axes of the plan; but since the Second and Great Pyramids 
have the same orientation to within two minutes of arc - a remarkably small divergence - these 
differences average only about 5 cm. The Third Pyramid, however, differs in azimuth from the 
Second and Great Pyramids by about 1/3 degree in a clockwise direction, so that elements of about 
25 cm are generated at the corners relative to the mean components of spacing. The exact positions 
can be calculated using Petrie's original survey coordinates (see below).

When the various dimensions are expressed in terms of the Royal Egyptian Cubit, with the value 
of 20.620 inches or 0.52375 metres as determined by Petrie from his measurements inside the 
Great Pyramid10  and as stated by Edwards,11 it is found that almost all of the mean components of 
spacing correspond to whole numbers of cubits, or in some cases half numbers of cubits, to within 
0.1 cubit. With reference to these potential design values, as listed in Table III, the largest error is 
only 0.23 cubit or 12 centimetres.

The Lehner/Goodman and Glen Dash Surveys 
 In 1984, Mark Lehner and David Goodman began the Giza Plateau Mapping Project, which was 
intended to produce a topographical contour map of the plateau on a scale large enough to allow 
the positions of monuments and other archaeological features to be accurately recorded.  In the 
following year, Lehner and Goodman published a map of the Giza plateau which some theorists 
assumed was the result of this new survey work. In fact, however, the various monuments and 
features were traced from  the 1:5000 photogrammetric map which had been prepared by the 
Egyptian Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction, with the assistance of aerial photographs. 
Although the EMHR map carries the framework of a grid which could have been used to locate 
structures on the plateau with sufficient accuracy for archaeological purposes,  Goodman and 
Lehner decided to construct a new grid with an origin located at the notional centre of the Great 
Pyramid.  This point does not exist on the ground and can only be deduced by reconstructing the 
pyramid’s sides and corners. It was assigned the coordinates of 100,000 north and 50,000 east, in 
consequence of which the coordinates of structures west of the origin require the prefix of 499, 
while those to south of the origin are prefixed by 99 – a complication which could easily have been 
avoided by placing the origin outside the area of the plateau. Surprisingly, Lehner’s grid is subject 
to an error of scaling of about 1 part in 50, so that the grid coordinates of the Third Pyramid, for 
example,  are displaced  by about 18 metres. 
Confirmation of the accuracy of Petrie's findings has come from the surveys carried out in 2012 
and 2015 by the Glen Dash Foundation in conjunction with Ancient Egypt Research Associates, 
continuing the work of Lehner and Goodman for the GPMP some thirty years earlier.12 By locating 
Petrie’s original station marks at the corners of the Great Pyramid, and referring to Petrie’s stated 
coordinates for these stations,  it has emerged that the standard of length implied by the base-line 
of Petrie’s triangulation was effectively lacking by about 1 part in 5,000 – a discrepancy which 
Petrie himself noted when he compared his findings with the baseline of the previous survey by 
David Gill.13  Taking this into account in a significant endorsement of Petrie's work, Glen Dash

13  See Petrie, Pyramids and Temples p. 205-7.  The shortfall may perhaps be ascribed to Petrie’s base-line measuring 
equipment, which was of his own devising .

has converted Petrie's coordinates for the corners and centres of the pyramids into coordinates in 
the GPMP grid,14  to give the best possible estimates for these positions. 
Petrie’s coordinates for the corners of the Second and Third Pyramids, as transformed by Glen 
Dash to the cardinal orientation of the GPMP grid and expressed as northings and eastings, are 
listed in Table IV. The positions of the corners are then stated as southings and westings relative to 
the centre of the Great Pyramid. Next, the coordinates are transformed to the azimuth of the site 
plan of –4’ 56” relative to the cardinal points and stated as distances southwards and westwards 
from the north-east corner of the Great Pyramid. Finally, these distances are converted into royal 
cubits of 0.52382 m or 20.623 inches.15  The average difference in the placing of the pyramid 
corners with respect to the proposed design values as shown is only 0.07 cubit or 3.6  cm.

Analysis of the Giza Site Plan 
To investigate the possibility of a deliberate positional relationship between the bases of the three 
pyramids, it seems reasonable to assume that any dimensional scheme would have been laid out 
starting from the base of the Great Pyramid, which was the first of the Giza pyramids to be

original analysis.

constructed. The dimensions would thus have been measured out from the north-eastern area of the 
plateau, southwards and westwards towards the Second and Third Pyramids. The task of setting 
out the plan would have been no more difficult in principle than laying out the base of a single 
pyramid, and it will be noted that the components of spacing between the three pyramids are in 
each case shorter than the side-length of the Great Pyramid. 
Before the extensive quarrying of the rock for building stone took  place, the natural 
surface of the Giza plateau had a general slope of around 5 degrees, and the projection onto 
the horizontal plane of a measurement taken over the surface would have been reduced by 
about 0.4%. Thus the dimensions of the site plan could have been laid out with reasonable  
accuracy without correcting for the slope of the plateau. Once the approximate position for 
each pyramid had been determined, however, the sites were leveled around the perimeter, 
and may also have been connected by temporary horizontal-topped embankments so that 
the east-west and north-south components of spacing between the three pyramid bases 
could be laid down with the greatest accuracy. While ropes may have been used in the 
initial marking out of the site plan, the observed accuracy in the finished dimensions was 
probably achieved  through the use of pairs of butting measuring rods laid alternately end 
over end – a method capable of achieving a high degree of precision.16 
 
The Great Pyramid 
It is generally accepted that the sides of the Great Pyramid measure 440 cubits, although 
only the longest or south side has exactly this length according to the survey by Cole.17  In 
terms of the Giza royal cubit of 0.52375 metres or 20.620 inches, the actual mean side of 
230.364 metres corresponds to 439.8 cubits, with an average variation in the sides of only 6 
cm or 0.1 cubit. Petrie suggested that an adjustment had been effected such that the 
perimeter of the base would express the 'pi-proportion' in relation to the height of 280 
cubits, with greater accuracy than the value for π of 22/7.18 In this case, the theoretical side-
length will be  (140 × π) or 439.822... cubits.  
Although the mean side-length of the Great Pyramid in the survey by the Glen Dash 
Foundation is just 1 mm less than Cole’s mean result, small differences in the alignment of 
the individual sides give rise to variations in the side-lengths which cannot now be resolved.. 
Cole’s findings must take precedence over those of Glen Dash, however, because the traces 
of the casing-edge were better preserved. The use of regression analysis by the GDF team to 
detemine confidence limits for the lengths of the sides is flawed because the data does not 
satisfy the statistical requirements. 
 
The Placing of the Second Pyramid 
Turning now to the position of the Second Pyramid relative to the Great Pyramid, the 
analysis of Petrie's survey data shows that the mean north-south spacing between the two 
pyramids is 250.2 cubits. It seems likely, therefore, that the builders intended to place the 
north side of the Second Pyramid on a line just 250 cubits southwards from the south side of

the Great Pyramid. Taking further distances along the north-south axis, the impression of a 
deliberate design is strongly supported. The distance southwards from the north side of the 
Great Pyramid to the south side of the Second Pyramid is 1101 cubits, or only 0.1% greater 
than the round-figure of 1100 cubits. This is just 2½ times the side of the Great Pyramid of 
440 cubits, and the south sides of the two pyramids are separated by an axial distance from 
north to south of about 3/2 × 440 or 660 cubits.  
From these plausible formative dimensions of 440 and 250 cubits, we can now obtain a 
provisional design-value for the side-length of the Second Pyramid as follows: 
 
Nominal  Side-length of Second Pyramid = 440 × 3/2 - 250 = 410 cubits 
 
I have termed this the nominal side-length of the Second Pyramid, because Petrie's survey-
data gives an actual mean side of of 8474.9 inches or exactly 411 cubits. The average 
variation in the sides from their mean length is only 1.5 inches or 4 cm. Thus although the 
above derivation accounts for a dimension of about 410 cubits in preference to one of just 
400 cubits, an adjustment of one cubit appears to have been made to the actual side-length. 
Reasons for this adjustment will be given shortly. 
Now taking dimensions along the east-west axis, Petrie's data places the west side of the 
Second Pyramid 624 cubits westwards from the west side of the Great Pyramid. Again with 
an adjustment of one cubit, therefore, this dimension may be equated with a nominal value of 
2½ × 250 or 625 cubits, making it analogous to the distance of 2½ × 440 or 1100 cubits along 
the north-south axis. Hence the side-length of the Second Pyramid and the position relative to 
the Great Pyramid may be ascribed to a simple design based upon modules of 440 and 250 

[Page 8]

cubits. The side-length of the Second Pyramid is defined as (1½ × 440 - 250) or 410 cubits, 
while the east-west spacing from the Great Pyramid is found to be (625 - 410) or 215 cubits: 
With reference to this modular scheme, however, the builders evidently subtracted one cubit 
from the dimension of 625 cubits, and added one cubit to the dimension of 1100 cubits, 
making the side-length of the Second Pyramid equal to 411 cubits, while the east-west 
spacing from the Great Pyramid became (624 - 411) or 213 cubits (see Table III). These 
adjustments suggest that further factors influenced the final choice of dimensions; and indeed 
these factors are found to have anticipated the inclusion of the Third Pyramid in the 
completed ground plan.  
 
The Enclosing Rectangle of the Site Plan 
As shown by the survey-data in Table III, the Third Pyramid extends the scheme of the Second 
and Great Pyramids by 631 cubits towards the south and 353.5 cubits towards the west. The 
overall dimensions of the Giza site plan are thereby defined along the two axes. Computing these 
enclosing dimensions from the component parts, we find:  
Overall East-West Dimension    = 440 + 624 + 353.5 = 1417.5 cubits  
Overall North-South Dimension = 440 + 661 + 631 = 1732 cubits 

[Page 9]

Rather surprisingly,  these dimensions  represent the square roots of the first two prime numbers, 
two and three, multiplied by a factor of 1000. The theoretical values are: 
 
                   
1000√2 = 1414.21... ,      1000√3 = 1732.05... 
While the north-south dimension thus expresses the value of 1000√3 exactly, the east-west 
dimension displays a discrepancy of about 3.3 cubits with respect to the exact value of 1000√2. 
This apparent error amouts to only about 0.2%, however, and is explained by other factors in the 
formulation of the dimensions, as we will see. 
The occurrence of these square root values in the dimensions of the Giza plan points to a 
geometrical development beginning with a square of 1000 cubits, as shown in the diagram below. 
The east-west dimension of 1000√2 cubits is first obtained as the diagonal length in this square, 
which is marked off along the north side to give the overall dimension from east to west. A 
rectangle measuring 1000 by 1000√2 cubits is then constructed, with a diagonal length of 1000√3 
cubits which is marked off along the east side to give  the overall dimension of the plan from north 
to south. 
The validity of this geometry is confirmed by the ease with which it can be extended so as to 
define the major division of the plan which takes place at the south side of the Second 
Pyramid.  It is in fact only necessary to draw in the diagonal of the enclosing rectangle on a 
plan of √2 : √3 to obtain a point of intersection with the opposing diagonal of the initial square 
on a plan of 1 : 1.  This defines a length of diagonal equal to the dimension of 1101 cubits 
which encloses the Second and Great Pyramids from north to south, as shown below .                             
 
It will be seen that the diagonal rising from southern end of the base-line of 1000√3 cubits on a 
plan of  √2 : √3, intersects the diagonal rising from northern end on a plan of 1:1, such as to 

[Page 10]
The Plan of the Giza Pyramids 
 
10 
divide the base-line in the ratio of √2 : √3. Consequently, the length marked off along  the 1 : 1 
diagonal will be: 
                       √2 
1000 √3  ×   --------    ×  √2  =  1101.020…cubits 
                   √2 + √3 
Hence nearly the exact whole number of 1101 cubits which we earlier ascribed to a simple 
modular scheme adjusted by one cubit,  is now seen to have had its origin in the most 
fundamental geometry of the enclosing rectangle of the site plan. 
 
It is also possible to construct the enclosing rectangle starting from a double square or 1:2 
rectangle of 1000  × 2000 cubits.  While the east-west dimension of 1000√2 cubits is given 
 once again by the diagonal in each component square of 1000 cubits,  the north-south 
dimension is constructed with reference to the diagonal of the double square of 1000√5 
cubits. When this dimension is applied as  the hypotenuse in a right triangle having the 
dimension of 1000√2 cubits as base,  the height of the triangle will be 1000√3 cubits. The 
hypotenuse, furthermore, intersects the opposing diagonal of one component square so as to 
divide the length of the double square in the exact ratio of √2 : √3, or into parts of 899 and 
1101 cubits. Thus the major north-south division of the site plan is defined as before.

Needless to say, these geometrical constructions are conceptual and would have been 
worked out by the architect on a convenient scale on a drawing board or scribing floor.  
Only the pyramid bases and the components of spacing between them had to be marked  
out on the ground of the Giza plateau. 
Completion of the Site Plan 
The evaluation of Petrie's survey-data shows that the north-south overall dimension of the 
Giza site plan together with the division at the south side of the Second Pyramid, satisfy the 
geometrical requirements with complete accuracy. The question therefore arises as to why 
the east-west overall dimension diverges from the value of 1000√2 or 1414.2 cubits by 
about three cubits. That this is not an error is initially indicated by the fact that the axial 
component of 353.5 cubits westwards from the Second Pyramid to the west side of the 
Third Pyramid has the value of 250√2 cubits:  
250√2 = 353.55... cubits 
Thus this dimension is accurately one-quarter of the ideal overall dimension on the same 
axis. It is the length of the diagonal in the modular layout squares of 250 cubits, which define 
the north-south spacing between the Second and Great Pyramids and the dimension of about 
2½ × 250 or 625 cubits on the east-west axis. Adding this element of 353.5 cubits  to the 
distances as already defined in our initial modular scheme along the east-west axis gives an 
overall east-west dimension of (440 + 625 + 353.5) equals 1418.5 cubits, which is more than 
4 cubits greater than the value of 1000√2 cubits. Thus the subtraction of one cubit from the 
component of 2½ × 250 or 625 cubits may be seen as a judicious adjustment which improved 
the accuracy of the square-root value in the overall dimension, without unduly undermining 
the integrity of the modular scheme. This adjustment, furthermore, was balanced by the 
addition of one cubit to the modular dimension of 2½ × 440 or 1100 cubits, to satisfy the    
fundamental division of the overall dimension at the south side of the Second Pyramid. 
The mathematical import of the site plan is greatly enhanced by the expression of the square 
roots of 2, 3, 5 and 7, in each case multiplied by the module of 250 cubits.  The side-length 
of the Second Pyramid  being 411 cubits, the axial distance westwards from the centre of the 
Second Pyramid to west side of the Third Pyramid is:  
411/2 + 353.5  =  559 cubits  
          
 
and     250√5  =  559.01...  
The east-spacing between the Second Pyramid and Great Pyramid being (624 - 411) or 213 cubits,  
the axial distance westwards from the centre of the Great Pyramid to the east side of the Second 
Pyramd is found to be: 
 
 
 
440/2 + 213  =  433 cubits 
 
 
       and       250√3  =  433.01.. 

[Page 12]
The Plan of the Giza Pyramids

This is the length of diagonal in the rectangle measuring 250 × 250√2 cubits, which is contained in 
the Giza site plan between the north-south dimension of 250 cubits and the east-west dimension of 
353.5 cubits. It is now evident that a 1 : √3 : 2 right triangle with hypotenuse of 500 cubits and 
adjacent sides of 250 and 433 cubits can be constructed on the spacing between the Second and 
Great Pyramids, as shown below.  
 
Finally,  the axial distance southwards from the Great Pyramid to the south side of the Second 
Pyramid is:  
                                                   (250 + 411) = 661 cubits  
and    250√7 = 661.437...  
In closely connected dimensions along the two axes of the plan, therefore, the square roots 
of two, three, five, and seven are all accurately represented in terms of a module of 250 
cubits.  Three  of these square-roots values are represented elsewhere in the plan with a 
factor of 1000 cubits..Given that the site plan contains only seven independent dimensions 
– the three pyramid bases and the four components of spacing -  the fact that seven square 
root values are expressed in the dimensions is remarkable. 
It will be seen that the addition of one cubit to the nominal side of the Second Pyramid of 
410 cubits facilitated the accurate expression of 250√3 and 250√5 on the east-west axis, 
and also resulted in a good approximation to 250√7 on the north-south axis. This last 

[Page 13]

dimension is a natural product of the geometry already described., and can be constructed 
as the diagonal in a rectangle measuring 250√2 by 250√5 cubits, or as the diagonal in a 
rectangle measuring 250√3 by 500 cubits. In conclusion, the square roots of the first four 
prime numbers are all defined in the Giza plan in terms of the module of 250 cubits., which 
defines the north-south spacing between the Second and Great Pyramids. 
The Scheme of the Third Pyramid 
The Third Pyramid seems to have served primarily as a corner marker in the Giza site plan, and 
thereby extends the scheme of the Second and Great Pyramids by 353.5 cubits towards the west 
and 631cubits towards the south to define the enclosing rectangle of the plan.. It has dimensions of 
its own, however, which represent a significant development of the design. It so happens that the 
numbers 353.5 and 631 are in the almost exact ratio of 1: (1 + π/4), and can therefore be used to 
generate the pi-proportion of the Great Pyramid within the bounding 353.5 by 631 cubit rectangle  
                 

[Page 14]

Subtracting the short side from the long  side leaves a remainder of (631 – 353.5) or 277.5 cubits, 
which is in the ratio of  π : 4 to the short side of 353.5 cubits and so yields  the π/4 pyramid slope:.  
As shown in the diagram above, the side-length of the Third Pyramid is defined within the 
rectangle of 277.5 by 353.5 cubits.by the intersection of a line drawn on a plan of 1:1 from the 
SW corner, with a line drawn on a plan of 1:2 from the NE corner. This results in a space on 
the east side which is twice as wide as the space on the north side, giving dimensions of 152 
and 152/2 cubits respectively. The side-length of the Third Pyramid is thus found to be (353.5 
– 152) = (277.5 – 76) =  201.5 cubits, in agreement with Petrie's mean survey result of 4153.6 
inches or 201.44 cubits..  The element of 152 cubits determines the east-west spacing between 
the Second and Third Pyramids, and is exactly one-seventh of the consecutive axial distance of 
1064 cubits from the west side of the Second Pyramid to the east side of the Great Pyramid.. 
These relationships form the basis for a scheme of the circle squared, in which a square with 
a side of 500 cubits is circumscribed by a circle with radius of 250√2 or 353.5 cubits, and a 
circumference of 2220 cubits (for pi = 3.140).  To square the circle, a second square with a 
side of 555 cubits is centred on the first square but aligned along the diagonal, generating the 
elements as described above. 
 
 
 
 

[Page 15]

We must also note that the base of the Third Pyramid is equal to the side of a cube, the volume of 
which is  that of a sphere with a diameter equal to the module of 250 cubits.  The exact side-length 
required for this cubing of the sphere being 201.499 cubits, the result is not lacking in accuracy. 
 
The Orientation of the Third Pyramid 
The occurrence of half numbers of cubits in the planning of the Third Pyramid is associated with 
the slight difference in the orientation of this pyramid with respect to the axes of  the site plan, 
sufficient to shift the corners by 0.5 cubit in a clockwise direction relative to the midpoints of the 
sides. By this means, whole tens of cubits were introduced into dimensions which would otherwise 
have been greater or less by 0.5 cubit, and a secondary set of requirements for the dimensions 
relating to the Third Pyramid was facilitated. 
 
The north-south spacing between the Second and Third Pyramids was thus increased to 430 cubits 
when measured to the north-east corner of the Third Pyramid, but reduced to 429 cubits when 
measured to the north-west corner. The lesser dimension combines with the side-length of the 
Second Pyramid to give a distance of (429 + 411) or 840 cubits, which is just three times the 
height of the Great Pyramid.  It will also be seen that the north-west corner of the Third Pyramid is 
(429 + 1101) or 1530 cubits southwards from the northern boundary of the plan, while the south-
west corner is (354 + 411) equals 765 or 1530/2 cubits westwards  from the east side of the Second  
Pyramid. There is thus a hint of the further relationships which are hidden within structure of the 
plan.19  
 
Conclusion 
Whilst the wealth of evidence here presented leaves no doubt whatsoever that the three great Giza 
Pyramids are the components of a single unified site plan of surprising sophistication, it must be 
admitted that the existence of the plan is entirely unexpected by Egyptologists, and indeed makes 
liitle sense in the context of ancient Egyptian funerary architecture.  The Egyptian kings were not 
given to forming positional relationships between their tombs and those of their predecessors and 
successors,  and the mathematical nature of the design at Giza can hardly be explained by any 
known requirements of the funerary cult. 
 
Whereas the Egyptologist will see this as a reason to dismiss the site plan as a strange aberration 
that can have no relevance for their subject,  the true scientist will recognise the impossibility of 
the mathematical relationships having arisen by chance, especially given the accuracy, simplicity 
and coherence of the design,  and the consistency with which a particular theme – the expression 
of square roots – was pursued by the architect.  It is possible to envisage the occasional 
approximate occurrence of such numbers popping up in random sets of dimensions by chance, but 
the systematic and accurate expression of the square roots of the first four prime numbers with a 
factor of 250 cubits, duplicated in three instances with a factor of 1000 cubits, cannot possibly be 
dismissed as coincidence. 
 
                                                 
   19 . These results point to a further geometrical development of the plan as described in The Giza Site  
         Plan Revisited' in Göttinger Miszellen124 (1991).

If, as the present writer believes, the existence of the site plan cannot be reconciled with the 
funerary theory, then it is not the solid factual evidence of the dimensional relationhips that is at 
fault, for this is the bed-rock reality of the Giza site. The evidence for the usage of these pyramids 
as tombs by certain kings of the Fourth Dynasty, on the other hand, is secondary and superficial, 
and could be explained by the appropriation of pre-existing monuments. The Giza layout provides 
compelling evidence in support of the claim which is made in the Osirian Scripts,20 to the effect 
that the three pyramids were constructed as a centre for the initiation of priest-neophytes into the 
occult wisdom of ancient Egypt, some thousands of years before the founding of the historical 
First Dynasty. 
 
Needless to say, the notion that the Giza pyramids and temples could predate the Fourth Dynasty is 
unlikely to find many supporters in orthodox circles, but is nonetheless worthy of consideration in 
the view of the present writer.. The fact that the name of Khufu is found written on the internal 
masonry of the Great Pyramid in no way invalidates this possibility, since it is obvious that a king 
who wished to claim ownership of the monument would have been obliged to adopt the name of 
the original builder as his own, in order to avoid the need to erase the name from the fabric of the 
pyramid  – an  impossible task. 
 
The historical Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty would not, however, have wanted to be remembered as 
the appropriator of the Great Pyramid, but rather as the builder, and to this end it is conceivable 
that he required the population of Egypt to contribute stones towards its construction. Garbled 
references to this state of affairs may be found in the history of Herodotus, who tells us that Khufu 
plunged into all manner of wickedness.  He closed the temples, forbade the Egyptians from 
making offerings to the gods, and instead compelled them to labour one and all in his service.21  
He  raised money by prostituting his own daughter, who being bent on leaving a monument which 
would perpetuate her own memory, required each man to make her a present of a stone towards the 
works which she contemplated.. The records concerning the delivery of stones to the site which 
have recently been found at the port of Wadi el Jarf on the coast of the Red Sea have been assumed 
to support the conventional view of Khufu’s activities, but could equally show how officials were 
required to deliver stones to the Giza site and keep a detailed account of their contribution to the 
king’s faux pyramid-building exercise.. 
 
Leading Egyptologists have long recognised the difficulty of maintaining that a monument as vast 
as the Great Pyramid could have been built in the reign of one king.. The work load in terms of 
blocks of stone moved into position each day was simply too great. The idea that the Giza 
Pyramids predate the Fourth Dynasty may seem preposterous to many, but is justified by the 
records preserved by the Egyptians themselves in documents such as the Turin King List and the 
history of Manetho. Here we find mention of an era of remote antiquity known as Zep Tepi – the 
First Time - when Egypt was ruled by priest-initiates who founded the divine dynasties and were 
later revered as gods or demigods. Scattered across Egypt are monuments that date back to this era 
but are mostly deeply buried beneath the silt of the Nile, although some were restored and reused 
by the kings of the ‘authentic’ period..Amongst these monuments, its position carefully integrated 
with the Giza plan, the Great Sphinx still stands as the enduring guardian of the genuine mystery 
regarding which I have endeavoured throw a glimmering light.
