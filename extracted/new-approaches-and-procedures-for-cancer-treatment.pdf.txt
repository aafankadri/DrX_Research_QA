Introduction
Cancer is a global health problem responsible for one in six 
deaths worldwide. In 2020, there were an estimated 19.3 
million new cancer cases and about 10 million cancer deaths 
globally. Cancer is a very complicated sequence of disease 
conditions progressing gradually with a generalized loss of 
growth control.1–3 There were only a few options of cancer 
treatment for patients for many decades which include sur-
gery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as single treat-
ments or in combination.4,5 But recently, many pathways 
involved in cancer therapy progression and how they can be 
targeted has improved dramatically, with combinatorial 
strategies, involving multiple targeted therapies or “tradi-
tional” chemotherapeutics, such as the taxanes and platinum 
compounds, being found to have a synergistic eﬀect.6 New 
approaches, such as drugs, biological molecules, and 
immune-mediated therapies, are being used for treatment 
even if the excepted therapy level has not reached that 
resists the mortality rate and decreases the prolonged sur-
vival time for metastatic cancer.
The creation of a new revolution in neoplastic cancer or 
targeting drugs depends on the pathways and characteristics 
of different tumor entities.7 Chemotherapy is considered the 
most effective and widely used modality in treating cancers

Abstract
Cancer is a global health problem responsible for one in six deaths worldwide. Treating cancer has been a highly complex 
process. Conventional treatment approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have been in use, while 
significant advances are being made in recent times, including stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, ablation therapy, 
nanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis-based therapy. 
Current methods in oncology focus on the development of safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Stem cell therapy has 
brought promising efficacy in regenerating and repairing diseased or damaged tissues by targeting both primary and metastatic 
cancer foci, and nanoparticles brought new diagnostic and therapeutic options. Targeted therapy possessed breakthrough 
potential inhibiting the growth and spread of specific cancer cells, causing less damage to healthy cells. Ablation therapy 
has emerged as a minimally invasive procedure that burns or freezes cancers without the need for open surgery. Natural 
antioxidants demonstrated potential tracking down free radicals and neutralizing their harmful effects thereby treating or 
preventing cancer. Several new technologies are currently under research in clinical trials, and some of them have already 
been approved. This review presented an update on recent advances and breakthroughs in cancer therapies.

as used alone or in combination with radiotherapy. 
Genotoxicity is how chemotherapy drugs target the tumor 
cells mainly producing reactive oxygen species that largely 
destroy tumor cells.8 Hormonal treatments are also widely 
used for cancer malignancies and considered as cytostatic 
because it restricts tumor development by limiting the hor-
monal growth factors acting through the direction of hypo-
thalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPGA), hormone receptor 
blockage, and limiting of adrenal steroid synthesis.9
In this narrative review, a general overview of the most 
advanced and novel cancer therapies was provided. In addi-
tion, also new strategies currently under investigation at the 
research stage that should overwhelm the drawbacks of 
standard therapies; different strategies to cancer diagnosis 
and therapy; and their current status in the clinical context, 
underlining their impact as innovative anti-cancer approaches.
Cancer treatment modalities
We can see cancer treatment modalities by dividing them into 
conventional (traditional) and advanced or novel or modern 
categories. In this era worldwide, over half of all ongoing 
medical treatment trials are focusing on cancer treatments.7 
Entities, such as the type of cancer, its site, and severity, guide 
to select treatment options and its progress. The most widely 
used traditional treatment methods are surgery, chemotherapy, 
and radiotherapy, while modern modalities include hormone 
therapy, anti-angiogenic, stem cell therapies, immunotherapy, 
and dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.10
Conventional cancer therapies
The most recommended conventional cancer treatment strat-
egies include surgical resection of the tumors followed by 
radiotherapy with x-rays and/or chemotherapy.11 Of these 
modalities, surgery is most effective at an early stage of dis-
ease progression. Radiation therapy can damage healthy 
cells, organs, and tissues. Although chemotherapy has 
reduced morbidity and mortality, virtually all chemothera-
peutic agents damage healthy cells, especially rapidly divid-
ing and growing cells.12 Drug resistance, a major problem 
with chemotherapy, is a phenomenon wherein cancer cells 
that initially were suppressed by an anti-cancer drug develop 
resistance to the drug. This is caused primarily by reduced 
drug uptake and increased drug efflux.13 Limitations of con-
ventional chemotherapeutic modality, such as dosage selec-
tion difficulty, lack of specificity, rapid drug metabolism, 
and mainly harmful side effects.14
Advanced and innovative cancer 
therapies
Among the obstacles of cancer, drug resistance and its deliv-
ery systems are the most problem in cancer cure and decreas-
ing signs and symptoms; but currently, there are many 
approved treatment approaches and drugs. The efficiency of 
conventional cancer is reduced due to tumor pathology and 
architectural abnormality of tumor tissue blood vessels.15 
The following are the advanced and innovative cancer ther-
apy types with their benefits and challenges.
Stem cells therapy
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells present in the bone mar-
row (BM) with an ability to differentiate into any type of 
body cell. Stem cell therapeutic strategy is also one of the 
treatment options for cancer which are considered to be safe 
and effective. Application of stem cell is yet in the experi-
mental clinical trial; for example, their use in the regenera-
tion of other damaged tissue is being explored. Mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) are currently being used in trials that are 
delivered from the BM, fat tissues, and connective tissues.16
Pluripotent stem cells
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) isolated from the uniform 
inner mass cells of the embryo possess the flexibility to 
administer rise to any or all kinds of cells except those within 
the placenta. In 2006, the invention of Yamanaka factors to 
induce pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from physical cells in 
a culture marked a breakthrough in cell biology.17 Avoiding 
ethical issues from embryo destruction, iPSCs and ESCs 
have the same characteristics. Hematopoietic embryonic 
stem cells (hESCs) and iPSCs are currently used for the 
induction of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells,18 
and anti-tumor vaccine preparation.19
Adult stem cells
Adult stem cells (ASCs) groups often used in tumor therapy 
include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), MSCs, and neural 
stem cells (NSCs). HSCs, located in BM, can form all mature 
blood cells in the body. Currently, only approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) is the infusion of HSCs 
derived from cord blood to treat multiple myeloma and leu-
kemia.20 MSCs are found in many tissues and organs, play-
ing important roles in tissue repair and regeneration into 
cells, such as osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. 
MSCs have special biological characteristics and are used as 
complimentary with other approaches in treating tumors.21 
NSCs can self-renew and generate new neurons and glial 
cells and are used for treating both primary and metastatic 
breast and other tumors.22
Cancer stem cells
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are generated in normal stem cells 
or precursor/progenitor cells by the epigenetic mutations 
process. Their role in tumor treatment includes cancer 
growth, metastasis, and recurrence, so that it could give 
promise in the treatment of solid tumors.23 Stem cells have 
several action mechanisms in treating the tumor. The homing

process is one mechanism which is a rapid migration of 
HSCs into defined stem cell niches in BM after that the 
transplants undergo the engraftment process before giving 
rise to specialized blood cells. This mechanism is dependent 
on the active interaction between stem cell CXCR4 receptors 
and requires their interaction with endothelial cells through 
LFA-1, VLA-4/5, CD44, and the secretion of matrix degra-
dable enzyme MMP-2/9.22 The second mechanism is the 
tumor-tropic effect in which the migration of MSCs toward 
tumor microenvironment (TM) after attraction by CXCL16, 
SDF-1, CCL-25, and IL-6 secreted by tumor cells and dif-
ferentiation of MSCs within the tumor cells which contrib-
utes to tumor stromal development.24 Stem cells also act by 
paracrine factor secretion, including extracellular vesicles 
(EVs) and soluble materials,25 and their differentiation 
capacity, such as transplanted HSCs, can give rise to all 
blood cell types.26
Generally, cancer treatment using stem cell therapy by 
various strategies, including transplantation of HSC,27 MSC 
infusion,28 therapeutic carriers,29 generation of immune 
effector cells,30 and vaccine production.31 The stem cell can-
cer therapy approach confronted the following side effects: 
(1) tumorigenesis, (2) adverse events in allogeneic HSC 
transplantation, (3) drug toxicity and drug resistance, (4) 
increased immune responses and autoimmunity, and (5) viral 
infection.22 Despite several successes, there are challenges, 
such as therapeutic dose control, low cell targeting, and 
retention in tumor sites, that should be investigated and over-
come in the future. In addition, existing results from stem 
cell technologies are highly encouraging for tumor treatment 
but it still needs further efforts to improve the safety and effi-
cacy before they could enter clinical trials. Table 1 summa-
rized the licensed list of stem cell therapies.
Targeted drug therapy
Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances 
which are sometimes interchangeably used as “molecularly 
targeted drugs,” “molecularly targeted therapies,” and “pre-
cision medicines.” Those drugs’ mechanism of action is by 
interfering with growth molecules which leads to blocking 
the growth and spreading of cancer.34 Tumor initiation and 
progression are determined by the TM of an atypical tumor 
which comprises endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle 
cells, fibroblasts, various inflammatory cells, dendritic cells, 
and CSCs. There are various signaling mechanisms and 
pathways that TM-forming cells dynamically interact with 
the cancerous cells which are suitable for sustaining a rea-
sonably high cellular proliferation. So, it is the area of 
research interest using TM conditions to mediate effective 
targeting measures for cancer therapy.35
Selectively treating cancer cells with conventional chem-
otherapy is difficult since it is similar to normal cells. So 
those problems are intervened by cellular mechanisms, such 
as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, proliferation pre-
vention, and interfering with metabolic reprogramming by 
targeted drug therapy agents.36 Modifying TM and targeting 
TM for drug delivery for effective treatment are two strate-
gies that can be used for the treatment of cancer.37 Targeted 
therapy drugs do work in different ways from standard 
chemotherapy drugs treatment like attacking cancer cells 
while doing less damage to normal cells which is a program-
ming that sets them apart from normal, healthy cells.38
Using targeted therapy markedly increased the survival 
rate for some diseases, for example, from 17% to 24% in 
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the addition of 
erlotinib to standard chemotherapy. Imatinib has had a dra-
matic effect on chronic myeloid leukemia, and rituximab, 
sunitinib, and trastuzumab have revolutionized the treatment 
of renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer, respectively.39
We can classify the targeted cell agents based on the 
mechanism of their work or their target site. Some enzymes 
serve as signals for cancer cells to grow. Some targeted ther-
apies inhibit enzymes that are signals for cancer cells to 
grow. These drugs are called enzyme inhibitors. Blocking 
these cell signals can inhibit cancer from getting bigger and 
spreading.40
Some targeted therapies are called apoptosis-inducing 
drugs because they are aimed right at the parts of the cell that 
control whether cells live or die. The examples are serine/
threonine kinase, protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which pro-
motes cell survival, and inhibitors of this protein are in the 
preclinical phase.41
These agents stop the tumors from making new blood 
vessels which helps cut off the tumors’ blood supply so that 
tumors cannot grow. In addition, they arrest tumor growth 
that involves by curtailing blood supply to the tumor by 
inhibiting angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) or its receptors. The study showed the 
survival of patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma

extended by months after the use of Avastin (bevacizumab) 
in combination with 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.42
Types of target agents
Monoclonal antibodies
Antibody drugs are man-made versions of immune system 
proteins administered intravenously to attack certain tar-
gets on cancer cells. They contain a more proportion of 
human components than murine components.43 Their attack 
mechanisms of action are recruiting host immune functions 
to attack the target cell, binding to ligands or receptors 
thereby interrupting essential cancer cell processes, and 
carrying a lethal payload, such as radioisotope or toxin, to 
the target cell.44 Gemtuzumab is an example of a CD-33-
specific monoclonal antibody currently used for AML 
treatment by conjugating with calicheamicin.45 In addition, 
ibritumomab tiuxetan is an anti-CD20, a 90Y metal iso-
tope-based is developed in clinical therapy.46 Delivery of 
active therapeutics, prodrug activation enzymes, and chem-
otherapy toxins are also another use of target agents of 
monoclonal antibodies.47
Small molecule inhibitors
These are smaller protein in size (⩽500 Da) than monoclonal 
antibodies, so that they can simply translocate through 
plasma membranes and can be taken orally. Their main func-
tion is interrupting cellular processes by interfering with the 
intracellular signaling of tyrosine kinases which leads to the 
inhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling and initiates a molecu-
lar cascade that can lead to the inhibition of cell growth, pro-
liferation, migration, and angiogenesis in malignant tissues.48 
Examples of small molecule inhibitors are gefitinib and erlo-
tinib which inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
kinase and EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients, respectively. There are also lapatinib and sorafenib 
which act on the inhibition of EGFR/Erb-B2 Receptor 
Tyrosine Kinase 2 (ERBB2) for ERBB2-positive breast can-
cer and VEGFR kinase, in renal cancer.49
Ablation cancer therapy
Ablation is a treatment technique that destroys tumors with-
out removing them mostly indicated for small-size tumors of 
less than 3 cm and the surgical option is contraindicated. 
Ablation is also used with embolization for larger tumors. 
However, this technique might not be indicated for treating 
tumors near major blood vessels, the diaphragm, or major 
bile ducts due to destroying some of the normal tissue around 
the tumor.50
Thermal ablation
This technique uses extreme hyperthermia or hypothermia to 
destruct tumor tissue concentrating on a focal zone in and 
around the tumor. Similar to surgery, thermal ablation 
removes the tumor and a 5–10 mm thick margin of seem-
ingly normal tissue but the tissue is killed in situ and then 
absorbed by the body later. The procedure is similar to sur-
gery using an open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic approach 
but is commonly applied using a percutaneous or non-inva-
sive approach. The type of tumor, site, physician’s choice, 
and health status determine the approach.51
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, 
high-intensity focused ultrasound, and cryoablation are cur-
rently being used in the clinical setting. Cryoablation uses a 
hypothermic modality to induce tissue damage by a freeze-
thaw process against others. All these treatments operate on 
the principle of hyperthermia except cryoablation. Of all the 
ablation techniques, cryoablation demonstrated the highest 
potential to elicit a post-ablative immunogenic response.52
Recent studies showed additional to tissue disruption 
RFA and cryoablation can modulate the immune system that 
they were applied as therapy on TM and in the systematic 
circulation. Evidence has shown that ablation procedures 
affect carcinogenesis due to its local inflammatory response 
leading to an immunogenic gene signature.53
The advantage of this procedure over surgery is that it 
provides a minimal (e.g. percutaneously or laparoscopically) 
or non-invasive approach to cancer therapy and gets atten-
tion as an alternative to standard surgical therapies.54
Cryoablation
Cryoablation is one of the ablation techniques which ablates 
the extensive tissue by freezing to lethal temperatures fol-
lowed by liquid formation, causing extensive tissue. Benign 
and malignant primary tumors are mostly treated by this 
therapy.55 James Arnott reported that the freezing tempera-
tures can impair cancer cell viability after he attempted the 
usage of cold temperatures by salt and ice solutions for the 
generation of local numbness before surgical operations in 
the nineteenth century. He suggested cryoablation as an 
attractive therapeutic option and increased a patient’s 
survival.56
Cryoablation techniques are based on the principle of the 
Joule–Thomson effect which was studied in the 1930s by 
many researchers and concluded using liquid CO2 under 
high pressure, liquid air, and liquid oxygen to achieve the 
cooling effect and the subsequent formation of ice crystals so 
employed to treat lesions, warts, and keratosis. However, 
after 1950, Allington replaced liquid N2 for the treatment of 
various skin lesion disorders.47
RFA therapy
RFA is a minimally invasive procedure and an image-guided 
technique using hyperthermic (high-frequency electrical 
currents) conditions to destroy cancer cells. Imaging tech-
niques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), guide needle electrodes

into a tumor cell. Generally, RFA is the most effective 
approach for treating small-size tumors of less than 3 cm in 
diameter. RFA can be used in combination with other con-
ventional cancer treatment options.57 After starting the use of 
deployable devices or multiple-electrode systems, RFA can 
treat medium tumors (up to 5 cm diameter).58
Gene therapy
Gene therapy is the insertion of a normal copy of a defective 
gene in the genome to cure a specific disorder. The first 
application dates back to 1990 when a retroviral vector was 
exploited to deliver the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene to 
T cells in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID). Approximately, about 2900 gene therapy clinical tri-
als are currently ongoing, two-third of which are related to 
cancer. Strategies, such as expression of proapoptotic and 
chemosensitizing genes, expression of wild-type tumor sup-
pressor genes, expression of genes able to solicit specific 
anti-tumor immune responses, and targeted silencing of 
oncogenes, are under evaluation for cancer gene therapy.47
Thymidine kinase (TK) gene delivery is effective for the 
administration of prodrug ganciclovir to activate its expres-
sion and induce specific cytotoxicity.59 The p53 tumor sup-
pressor gene which is vectors carrying has been assessed for 
the clinical purpose very recently. ONYX-015 has been 
tested in NSCLC patients and gave a high response rate 
when given alone or combined with chemotherapy.60 
Gendicine, a recombinant adenovirus carrying wild-type 
p53-induced complete disease regression in head and neck 
squamous cell cancer had similar success when combined 
with radiotherapy.61
Some challenges that have been faced with gene therapy 
are the selection of the right conditions and the choice of the 
best delivery mechanism. Identified drawbacks of this ther-
apy are genome integration, limited efficacy in specific sub-
sets of patients, and high chances of being neutralized by the 
immune system. Basic research and medical translation used 
RNA interference (RNAi) as an efficient technology that 
able to produce targeted gene silencing.62 RNA-induced 
silencing complex (RISC) mediates the targeted gene silenc-
ing process by cleaving the messenger RNA (mRNA) and 
interference with protein synthesis.63 A siRNAs can be 
designed to block desired targets, involving cell proliferation 
and metastatic invasion; hence, precise molecular mecha-
nisms are a triggering factor for tumor formation. This 
method relies on siRNA-mediated gene silencing of anti-
apoptotic proteins, transcription factors (i.e. c-myc gene),64,65 
or cancer mutated genes (i.e. K-RAS).66
Advantages of siRNA-based drugs are safety, high effi-
cacy, specificity, few side effects, and low costs of produc-
tion.67 However, occasionally, they can induce off-target 
effects or elicit innate immune responses, followed by spe-
cific inflammation.68 Delivery methods currently under study 
are chemical modification (insertion of a phosphorothioate at 
3’ end, introduction of a 2’ O-methyl group, and modification 
by 2,4-dinitrophenol) and lipid encapsulation, or conjugation 
with organic molecules (polymers, peptides, lipids, antibod-
ies, small molecules) efficiently target to spontaneously cross 
cell membranes of naked siRNAs.69 Interaction of cationic 
liposomes with negatively charged nucleic acids facilitates 
easy transfection by simple electrostatic interactions.70 They 
can be constituted by 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium 
propane (DOTAP) and N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N, 
Ntrimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTMA).71 Currently, 
a Phase I clinical trial is recruiting patients for evaluating the 
safety of Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) targeting 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) encapsulated siRNA 
(siRNA-EphA2- DOPC) in patients with advanced and recur-
rent cancer.72 siRNAs can be concentrated in cationic poly-
mers, such as chitosan, cyclodextrin, and polyethyleneimine 
(PEI).73 CALAA-01 is one of the cyclodextrin polymers con-
jugated with human transferrin is being entered a Phase I 
clinical trial. PEI has been used as an anti-cancer by forming 
small cationic nanoparticles and loading with human epider-
mal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2 receptor)-specific 
siRNA.74 Phase II clinical trial has been started to evaluate 
Local Drug EluteR (siG12D LODER) directed to mutated 
Kirsten rat sarcoma (K-RAS) oncogene for the treatment of 
advanced pancreatic cancer. Conjugating to peptides, anti-
bodies, and aptamers improves stability during circulation 
and enhances cellular uptake of siRNAs.75 The introduction 
of nanocarriers has largely improved siRNAs stability, phar-
macokinetics and biodistribution properties, and targeting 
specificity. Polyallylamine phosphate nanocarriers have been 
developed to release siRNAs in the cytoplasm after disassem-
bly at low endosomal pH.76
Dose correction and variabilities between individuals and 
different stages of disease are challenging issues on clinical 
translation of the siRNA-based approach. In the future, the 
needed research is on setting up the best-personalized ther-
apy and toward controlled release to reach only specific tar-
gets on treating the tumor. Table 2 summarizes the gene 
therapy drugs based on their mechanism of action and 
induction.
Natural antioxidants
Day to day, the anatomy undergoes many exogenous insults, 
such as ultraviolet (UV) rays, pollution, and tobacco smoke, 
that end in the assembly of reactive species, particularly oxi-
dants and free radicals, liable for the onset of many diseases, 
together with cancer. These molecules can even be made as a 
consequence of clinical administration of medication; how-
ever, they are additionally naturally created within our cells 
and tissues by mitochondria and peroxisomes, and from 
macrophages metabolism, throughout traditional physiologi-
cal aerobic processes.47

Oxidative stress and radical oxygen species can signifi-
cantly change the regulation of transcription factors by dam-
aging the DNA and other bio-macromolecule.77
Vitamins, polyphenols, and plant-derived bioactive com-
pounds are natural antioxidants used as preventive and thera-
peutic drugs against these molecules that damage the body 
due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.78 
Studies added to cancer therapy after appreciating their anti-
proliferative and proapoptotic properties. Compounds, such 
as vitamins, alkaloids, flavonoids, carotenoids, curcumin, 
berberine, quercetin, and others, are examples of natural 
antioxidants screened in vitro and in vivo.79
Limited bioavailability and/ or toxicity is one of the chal-
lenges of natural drugs while their translation into clinical 
practice.47 Curcumin has cytotoxic effects in different kinds 
of tumors, such as the brain, lung, leukemia, pancreatic, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma,80 while sparing normal cells at 
effective therapeutic doses. The curcumin’s biological prop-
erties, treatment duration and efficient therapeutic doses are 
under study.80 This day, about 27 clinical trials are done, 
while 40 are under study on curcumin.
Berberine is an alkaloid compound that has been studied 
to be effective against different cancers as a chemopreven-
tive agent, modulating many signaling pathways. Different 
nanotechnological strategies have been developed to facili-
tate its delivery across cell membranes due to their poorly 
soluble in water.81 Six clinical trials are under study and two 
have been completed.
Quercetin is another natural plant origin agent that is 
effective alone and also in combination with chemotherapeu-
tic agents in treating many cancers, such as lung, prostate, 
liver, colon, and breast cancers.82 Quercetin’s mechanism of 
action is by binding to cellular receptors and the interference 
of several signaling pathways.83 Currently, six clinical trials 
are under study and seven studies have been completed.
Current clinical trials
In recent years, analysis of cancer medication has taken out-
standing steps toward more practical, precise, and fewer 
invasive cancer treatments in the research of clinical trials 
(Figure 1).
Currently, the most frequent entries focusing on cancer 
therapies in the database of clinical trials (www.clinicalTri-
als.gov) include the terminologies stem cell, targeted ther-
apy, immunotherapy, and gene therapy because they are 
very promising and effective. Table 3 summarizes the poten-
tial advantages and disadvantages of the new treatment 
approaches.
Table 4 summarizes the approaches to advanced cancer 
therapies and their respective delivery systems with examples.
Conclusion
Current methods in oncology focus on the development of 
safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Targeted medical 
care helped rising the biodistribution of recent or already 
tested chemotherapeutical agents around the specific tissue 
to be treated; different methods, such as sequence medical 
care, siRNAs delivery, therapy, and inhibitor molecules, sup-
ply new potentialities to cancer patients. Gene therapy acts 
by direct in situ insertion of exogenous genes into benign 
tumors. Noticeably, stem cells can be used as regenerative 
medicine, therapeutic carriers, drug targeting, and generation 
of immune cells because of having unique biological actions 
on other cells.22 On the opposite hand, thermal ablation and 
magnetic hyperthermia are promising alternatives to the 
growth surgical process. Finally, radionics and pathomics 
approaches facilitate the management of huge knowledge 
sets from cancer patients to enhance prognosis and out-
comes. Much progress has been made, but many others are 
likely to come soon, producing more and more ad hoc
