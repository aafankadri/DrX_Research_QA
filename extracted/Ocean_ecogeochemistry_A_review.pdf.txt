animal movements and the acquisition and allocation of resources provide mechanisms for indi-
vidual behavioural traits to propagate through population, community and ecosystem levels of 
biological organization. Recent developments in analytical geochemistry have provided ecolo-
gists with new opportunities to examine movements and trophic dynamics and their subsequent 
inluence on the structure and functioning of animal communities. we refer to this approach as 
ecogeochemistry—the application of geochemical techniques to fundamental questions in popula-
tion and community ecology. we used  meta- analyses of published data to construct δ2H, δ13c, δ15N, 
δ18O and Δ14c isoscapes throughout the world’s oceans. These maps reveal substantial spatial vari-
ability in stable isotope values on regional and  ocean- basin scales. we summarize distributions of 
dissolved metals commonly assayed in the calciied tissues of marine animals. Finally, we review 
stable isotope analysis (SIa) of amino acids and fatty acids. These analyses overcome many of 
the problems that prevent bulk SIa from providing suficient geographic or trophic resolution in 
marine applications. we expect that ecologists will increasingly use ecogeochemistry approaches 
to estimate animal movements and trace nutrient pathways in ocean food webs. These studies will, 
in turn, help provide the scientiic underpinning for  ecosystem- based management strategies in 
marine environments.
Introduction
The acquisition and allocation of resources are fundamental requirements for all animals and sig-
niicantly inluence behaviour, population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. animal movement 
plays a critical role in resource acquisition and the transfer of these resources among locations. 
Trophic and movement ecology are therefore inextricably linked across a range of spatiotemporal 
scales within and among food webs. This connection extends to the techniques used to study con-
nections among habitats and trophic groups. Stable isotope analysis (SIa) and other geochemi-
cal methods have been used extensively in food web studies and, more recently, to trace animal 
movements across habitats with distinctive isotopic signatures (Hobson 1999, Boecklen et al. 2011). 
This convergence represents a new direction for the ield of ecogeochemistry, a term irst used by 
mizutani et al. (1991) to describe the use of SIa to infer diets of bats and subsequently expanded to 
include a range of geochemical approaches applied to ecological studies of food web dynamics and 
movement (mcmahon et al. 2013).

Ecologists have embraced the use of SIa in studies of marine food webs. a recent review found 
that nearly 60% of trophic ecology studies using SIas published between 2007 and 2009 were con-
ducted in marine or estuarine environments (Boecklen et al. 2011). However, while stable isotopes 
have been used in animal migration studies in terrestrial environments for several decades (Hobson 
1999, Rubenstein & Hobson 2004), the approach has received far less attention in marine systems 
(Fry 1981, Schell et al. 1989, Best & Schell 1996). This lack of effort may be due, at least in part, to 
a failure to recognize the degree of geographic variation in isotope and element abundances across 
marine environments (Hobson 1999, Rubenstein & Hobson 2004). compilations of maps showing 
spatial variation in isotope values have identiied marine isoscapes that are clearly suficient for use 
in movement studies over  ocean- basin scales (west et al. 2010, mcmahon et al. 2013).
The use of ecogeochemical approaches to examine trophic dynamics and movement patterns 
of animals offers signiicant advantages over traditional methods in marine environments. For 
instance, the use of stable isotopes has overcome at least some of the problems associated with 
stomach content analysis to determine diets (michener & Schell 1994). Ecogeochemistry has also 
been employed to overcome problems associated with conventional tagging methods of the early 
 life- history stages of marine animals (Thorrold et al. 2002, Becker et al. 2007). Finally, in some 
instances isotope analyses of ancient calciied tissues have provided a means of investigating eco-
logical processes over millennial timescales (limburg et al. 2011). Taken together, ecogeochemistry 
may allow for signiicant progress in a number of important, but as yet unresolved, questions in 
ocean ecology.
In this review, we outline the processes controlling isotope and elemental fractionation and 
summarize geographic gradients in isotope and elemental distributions in ocean and estuarine envi-
ronments. we assemble global ocean isoscapes for key elements in marine ecogeochemistry, includ-
ing seawater hydrogen (δ2HSw), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIc) (δ13cDIc), seawater radiocarbon 
(Δ14cSw), plankton carbon (δ13cPlK), plankton nitrogen (δ15NPlK) and seawater oxygen (δ18OSw). 
we summarize distributions of those minor and trace elements that are consistently and accurately 
analysed in the calciied tissues of marine ish and invertebrates and used as natural geochemical 
tags of natal origin (Thorrold et al. 1997). Finally, we highlight the potential for  compound- speciic 
stable isotope analyses, acknowledging that more research is needed in terms of understanding the 
processes controlling stable isotope fractionation of individual amino acids and fatty acids.
Data sources and isoscape methods
In this review, we have assembled isoscapes for a number of key elements in the marine environ-
ment. The data used to generate the isoscapes were collected from  meta- analyses of published 
isotope data. For δ2HSw and δ18OSw, all data were available on the global Oxygen-18 Database 
(Schmidt et al. 1999) on the National aeronautics and Space administration website (http://data.
giss.nasa.gov/ o18data/). Similarly, seawater radiocarbon (Δ14cSw) data were mined from the global 
Data analysis Project (glODaP) (Key et al. 2004). Seawater DIc δ13cDIc data were collected 
from glODaP (Key et al. 2004), the Open access library Pangaea (http://www.pangaea.de), and 
extensive searches of google Scholar and web of Science. Date for both Δ14cSw and δ13cDIc were 
predominantly more recent than the 1990s. The δ13cDIc data in the horizontal isoscape were from 
the top 100 m of the world’s oceans. Horizontal isoscapes of plankton δ13cPlK and δ15NPlK values 
were mined from extensive searches of google Scholar, web of Science, and several online data 
repositories, including Pangaea. we limited the plankton isoscape search to samples described as 
net plankton (<1 mm) collected in the euphotic zone (<150 m depth) and not preserved in formalin. 
The plankton isoscapes comprise a range of species but consist predominantly of copepods and 
similar zooplankton. To achieve the best spatial coverage, no attempts were made to sort data tem-
porally. However, most data presented are more recent than the 1990s. In addition to papers cited 
individually elsewhere in this review, data were obtained from the work of Sackett et al. (1965);

Isoscapes were generated using Ocean Data view (ODv) version 4.5.0 (Brown 1998, Schlitzer 
2002, http://odv.awi.de/). Data are displayed as  colour- shaded maps based on contouring of the orig-
inal data using the Data Interpolating variational analysis (DIva) gridding software. DIva soft-
ware was designed to interpolate data spatially (Barth et al. 2010). DIva gridding takes into account 
coastlines, subbasins and advection. calculations are highly optimized and rely on a  inite- element 
resolution. In particular, the  inite- element method takes into account the distance between analysis 
and data (observation constraint), the regularity of the analysis (smoothness constraint) and physical 
laws (behaviour constraint). Information about the DIva gridding software used by ODv can be 
found at http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/ mediawiki/ index.php/ DIva. Details of the algorithms employed 
by DIva gridding can be found at http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/ mediawiki/ index.php/ DIva_method.
Systematics
To be successfully applied in the ield, an ecogeochemistry approach must do each of the following 
(Hobson et al. 2010): (1) establish a baseline isoscape that characterizes distinct geochemical signa-
tures in different habitats or food web end members; (2) constrain tissue isotope turnover rates that 
determine the period of integration of geochemical signatures for a particular tissue; and (3) identify 
isotope or elemental fractionation factors between consumer and diet, or between animals and the 
ambient environment, that offset animal geochemical signatures from the baseline isotope val-
ues. The isotopic composition of elements in the marine environment is inluenced by a variety of 
physical, chemical and biological processes that together produce unique geographic distributions, 
termed isoscapes (west et al. 2010). Next, we provide a brief overview of the dominant sources of 
fractionation for elements commonly used in ecogeochemistry studies and discuss the resulting 
geographic distributions in the marine and estuarine environments. common reference standards 
for the elements discussed can be found in Table 1.

Hydrogen isotopes
Hydrogen isotope fractionation
Hydrogen has the largest mass difference between isotopes relative to mass and hence the great-
est variability of δ values of any element on Earth.  Physical- chemical processes governing hydro-
gen isotope fractionation in the marine environment include evaporation, precipitation, mixing 
and exchange reactions (Friedman 1953). Evaporation from a number of sources, including clouds, 
water bodies, soil and plant and animal respiration, forms an important basis for fractionation of 
hydrogen isotopes in the hydrologic cycle. Fractionation of hydrogen isotopes during evaporation is 
largely a kinetic process that depends on a number of factors and can, in turn, be quite large. vapour 
pressures of the isotopologues of water decrease with decreasing molecular weight; therefore, the 
heavy isotope (2H) will favour that part of the system in which it is more strongly bound, that is, 
the liquid phase (gat 1996). The same is true for condensation; therefore, during evaporation and 
condensation in an open system, the liquid phase of water becomes progressively enriched in 2H, 
while the vapour phase becomes progressively depleted. This process is known as Rayleigh distil-
lation (gat 1996). Rayleigh distillation has important implications for latitudinal gradients in ocean 
δ2H values of seawater (δ2HSw) as described in the next section. Hydrogen isotope fractionation 
factors for phase transitions of water are so large that even in  high- temperature systems like hydro-
thermal vents, signiicant variation in δ2HSw can be seen (Horita & wesolowski 1994). Further 
fractionation of hydrogen isotopes can take place at hydrothermal vents and  deep- water cold seeps 
during oxidation of H2 and cH4 to H2O and cO2. The pressure (depth) at which these reactions take 
place can also have an impact on hydrogen isotope fractionation (Horita 1999).
Hydrogen isotopes can also be fractionated by biological processes, including bacterially medi-
ated production of hydrogen gas and methane, both of which tend to be depleted in 2H (Krichevsky 
et al. 1961). Hydrogen isotope fractionation during photosynthesis typically results in organic mat-
ter that is relatively depleted in 2H; however, the individual steps involved in fractionation are still 
unclear (white 1989). It is important to note that at low temperatures water hydrogen will exchange 
quickly and reversibly with labile organic hydrogen bound in organic nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen 
compounds (werstiuk & Ju 1989). water at neutral pH and low temperature in the absence of a 
catalyst, however, does not readily exchange with most  carbon- bound hydrogen (Sternberg 1988), 
particularly hydrocarbons and lipids. Therefore, it is important to choose appropriate tissues that

ing to examine animal migration with stable hydrogen isotopes (Kelly et al. 2009).
Hydrogen isotope geographic variability
Surface δ2HSw values range from approximately –60‰ in the arctic Ocean to approximately 12‰ 
in parts of the mediterranean Sea (Figure 1). Rayleigh distillation is a fundamental process control-
ling latitudinal gradients in δ2HSw. as water vapour travels polewards and cools, some of the vapour 
condenses out as enriched precipitation, leaving the remaining vapour further depleted relative to 
its source. The water vapour becomes more depleted as the fraction of vapour remaining becomes 
smaller, until it is inally deposited as highly 2 H- depleted snow at the poles. This depletion can be 
modelled as follows:
 
2H/1Hv = 2H/1Hvo f (α–1),
where f is the fraction of vapour remaining, α is the equilibrium fractionation factor for the 
 water- vapour phase transition, and 2H/1Hv and 2H/1Hvo are the hydrogen isotope ratios of the cur-
rent and initial water vapour fractions, respectively. This process results in a gradient of δ2HSw 
values that are more negative with increasing latitude. δ2HSw values that are more negative also 
occur in regions of river  run- off from large drainage basins. Riverine and groundwater sources typi-
cally have δ2H values that relect the average isotope composition of precipitation that fell relatively 
recently into watersheds or recharge sites for that area (Kendall & coplen 2001). These freshwater 
sources introduce unique δ2H signatures into coastal areas that are consistently lower than δ2HSw 
values. The mouths of large rivers like the amazon can introduce anomalously low δ2H values that 
penetrate hundreds of kilometres into the atlantic Ocean. Similarly, deuterium can be a valuable 
tracer of subsurface groundwater sources (Sonntag et al. 1983), resulting in unique nearshore δ2HSw 
signatures that could be used to track animal migration within and among nearshore habitats. more 
positive δ2HSw values are typically observed in highly evaporative sites, such as the subtropical 
gyres, the mediterranean Sea and the arabian Sea. vertical proiles of δ2HSw generally tend to show 
less variation than the horizontal surface variation and covary with salinity.

It is interesting to note two exceptions to the patterns described. In the Paciic Ocean, the 
california current exhibits δ2HSw values that are more negative than would be predicted based on 
latitude due to advection of 2 H- depleted subpolar water towards the equator along the eastern Paciic 
Ocean. conversely, the  north- eastern North atlantic exhibits enriched δ2HSw values for its latitude 
due to polewards advection of 2 H- enriched  low- latitude water via the gulf Stream.
Carbon isotopes
Carbon-13 (13C)
13C fractionation carbon isotopes are fractionated during several reactions as they move through 
the environment and into food webs. The irst of these fractionation processes is caused by equili-
bration of cO2 between the atmosphere and the surface ocean DIc pool (Boutton 1991). The dis-
solution of cO2 in seawater occurs through the following reactions:

although the equilibration of cO2 alone is relatively fast (approximately 1 year), exchange 
between atmospheric cO2 and DIc that includes all the inorganic carbon species is a slower pro-
cess, on the order of about 10 years (Broecker & Peng 1974). at a typical surface seawater pH of 
8.2, seawater DIc has 91% bicarbonate ion, 8% carbonate ion, and 1% dissolved cO2. There is also 
signiicant  temperature- dependent fractionation of carbon isotopes among the various dissolved 
carbon species (Zeebe &  wolf- gladrow 2001). The δ13c value of cO2(atm) is approximately –8‰ 
(Keeling et al. 2005). at 25°c, carbon isotope fractionation between cO2(atm) and cO2(aq) is 1.3‰, 
and fractionation between cO2(aq) and bicarbonate ions is –9‰ (mook 1986, Zhang et al. 1995). 
Finally, fractionation between bicarbonate and carbonate ions was reported by mook (1986) to be 
0.4‰, although the value is not particularly well constrained (Zeebe &  wolf- gladrow 2001).
Photosynthetic marine organisms take up the lighter carbon isotope (12c) at a faster rate, 
with a δ13c fractionation value of approximately –19‰ between δ13cDIc and ixed organic carbon 
( lynch- Stieglitz et al. 1995). Internal biological parameters of primary producers, such as bio-
synthesis rate, enzymatic activity and cell lipid content, can signiicantly inluence their δ13cPlK 
values (Fry & wainright 1991, Hinga et al. 1994). The most prominent example of this differen-
tial fractionation during photosynthesis can be seen in the δ13c values of c3 and c4 plants. Plants 
using the c4 photosynthetic pathway typically have δ13c values that are more positive, ranging from 
–8‰ to –12‰, than c3 plants (-22‰ to –28‰) (see review by Farquhar et al. 1989). This difference 
is due to c4 plants using a different primary carboxylating enzyme, phosphenolpyruvate (PEP) car-
boxylase, and a different species of inorganic carbon than c3 plants that use  ribulose- bisphosphate 
 carboxylase- oxygenase (Rubisco). During photosynthesis, phytoplankton take up DIc, and after 
moderate kinetic fractionation, phytoplankton obtains a δ13c value between –16‰ and –24‰ 
(Peterson & Fry 1987).
13C geographic variability Temperature is a key physical parameter that inluences δ13c variabil-
ity of cO2 globally. The dissolved cO2 concentration of the surface mixed layer [cO2]aq is inversely 
related to  sea- surface temperature (SST) (weiss 1974), and cold waters with higher [cO2]aq tend to 
have lower δ13c values than warm waters. This process establishes a strong latitudinal gradient in 
surface ocean δ13c values of cO2 and DIc (Figure 2). Introduction of 13 c- depleted atmospheric cO2 
in regions of the ocean with prominent cO2 invasion, such as the North atlantic, results in relatively 
low surface water δ13cDIc  values. conversely, outgassing of cO2 in equatorial upwelling zones gives 
surface waters more positive δ13c values ( lynch- Stieglitz et al. 1995). Organic material is reminer-
alized as it sinks; therefore, water masses at depth are low in δ13cDIc value relative to surface waters, 

[Page 7]

with values typically approaching 0‰ (Figure 3). Upwelling events can also be a signiicant source 
of anomalously low surface δ13cDIc values (Kroopnick 1985).
The δ13c value of primary producers (δ13cPlK) is strongly inluenced by the δ13c value of the 
local DIc pool; thus, spatial variability in δ13cPlK is primarily driven by the same physical param-
eters (temperature and [cO2]aq) that inluence δ13cDIc values (Figure 4). For example, goericke & 
Fry (1994) demonstrated that phytoplankton δ13c values generally decreased with increasing lati-
tude as the δ13c of particulate organic carbon (POc) weakly tracked with temperature on a global 
scale. However, as mentioned, biological processes can also inluence phytoplankton δ13cPlK values 
and thus decouple these patterns in some situations (Fry & wainright 1991, Hinga et al. 1994, 
Kelly 2000).
Nearshore and benthic systems are typically more 13c-enriched than oceanic systems due to 
higher nutrient concentrations near shore causing greater overall productivity (France 1995). In 
addition, tighter terrestrial and  benthic- pelagic coupling in nearshore systems can increase inputs 
from 13 c- enriched benthic macrophytes and c4 marsh plants (France 1995). In contrast, pelagic 
waters are 13c-depleted owing to lower nutrient availability, lower phytoplankton growth rates and 
overall productivity and reduced contributions from benthic macrophytes. as a result, there are 
often steep gradients in δ13cbase values from nearshore to offshore and benthic to pelagic habitats. 
This gradient can be particularly pronounced in regions of strong upwelling or seasonal coastal 
phytoplankton blooms (Pancost et al. 1997).
There can also be signiicant seasonal variability in δ13c values at the base of marine food webs 
(δ13cbase) in many ocean ecosystems (gearing et al. 1984, cifuentes et al. 1988, goering et al. 1990, 
Ostrom et al. 1997). There are a number of factors that can contribute to seasonal variability in 
δ13cbase, including seasonal changes in water mass properties and luctuations in terrestrial  run- off, 
temperature and associated [cO2]aq, phytoplankton productivity and growth rate and primary pro-
ducer species composition. In general, seasonal variability is larger at high latitudes, with large 
variations in temperature and productivity, compared to  low- latitude, tropical systems. cifuentes 
et al. (1988) showed that the pattern of δ13c in suspended particulate matter varied by nearly 9‰ 
on seasonal timescales in the Delaware Estuary. goering et al. (1990) found a similar pattern with 
more than a 4‰ difference in net phytoplankton δ13cPlK values between april and may alone

during the seasonal spring bloom in coastal alaska. These seasonal luctuations in δ13c can be 
passed on to higher trophic levels as well, particularly for primary consumers with fast turnover 
rates (gearing et al. 1984, Simenstad & wissmar 1985, goering et al. 1990, Riera & Richard 1997). 
The transfer of such variability to consumers at the upper trophic level tends to diminish with 
increasing trophic level as a result of time averaging due to slower tissue turnover rates and feeding 
on multiple food sources, potentially across multiple food webs for highly mobile species (goering 
et al. 1990, O’Reilly et al. 2002). For instance, in the goering et al. (1990) study, zooplankton had a 
similar, although smaller, seasonal variability (δ13cPlK about 3‰) to net phytoplankton.
Carbon-14 (14C)
14C fractionation carbon has a naturally occurring, radiogenic isotope, 14c (radiocarbon), that 
may be a useful tracer of habitat use in the marine environment. Radiocarbon is created by cosmic 
ray bombardment of nitrogen in the atmosphere. In living organisms, radiocarbon exists at levels 
in isotopic equilibrium with their surroundings; when an organism dies, the 14c begins to decay at 
a predictable and measurable rate. This makes radiocarbon analysis useful for dating organic mat-
ter. In modern times, several anthropogenic perturbations have altered natural radiocarbon levels. 
Fossil fuel emissions introduced old, ‘dead’ radiocarbon into the atmosphere and led to a decrease 
of about 20‰ in atmospheric Δ14c values from 1890 to 1950 (Suess 1955, levin & Hesshaimer 
2000). In addition, atmospheric testing of atomic bombs in the 1950s and early 1960s resulted in 
a rapid and  well- documented increase in radiocarbon in the atmosphere, leading to disequilibrium 
with the world’s oceans and biosphere (Druffel & linick 1978). The initial rise of bomb radiocarbon 
in surface ocean waters from prebomb levels (approximately –50‰ in the Paciic Ocean and –65‰ 
to –45‰ in the atlantic Ocean) occurred in 1959 ± 1 year, and 14c levels rose relatively rapidly to 
peak Δ14c values between 1967 and 1970 (approximately 210‰ in the Paciic Ocean and 270‰ in 
the atlantic Ocean), with a subsequent slow but steady declining trend since then (Ostlund et al. 
1974, Stuiver et al. 1981, Nydal 1998). This bomb radiocarbon chronology is almost synchronous 
around the world in biogenic carbonates, such as coral skeletons, bivalve shells and ish otoliths 
(Druffel & linick 1978, Kalish 1993, weidman & Jones 1993), thus serving as a dated marker in 
calciied structures exhibiting periodic growth bands (Figure 5).

14C geographic variability The distribution of 14cDIc in the ocean is largely determined by  air- sea 
exchange of cO2 and ocean circulation (Siegenthaler 1989). Due to initial asymmetrical atmo-
spheric input, the Δ14cSw maximum values peaked 1–2 years earlier in the Northern Hemisphere 
compared to the Southern Hemisphere (linick 1978).  Deep- water masses that are isolated from the 
atmosphere and transported to depth via thermohaline circulation have Δ14cSw values that become 
more negative with increasing residence time in the ocean (Broecker et al. 1985, Jain et al. 1995) 
(Figure 6). For instance, the relatively young deep waters of the atlantic Ocean have Δ14cSw values 
on the order of –140‰, while the Δ14cSw values of older deep North Paciic waters are approxi-
mately –250‰ (Siegenthaler 1989, but see Druffel & williams 1990).
Seawater Δ14c values also can vary on regional scales, both horizontally and vertically. 
Subtropical gyres that entrain water at the surface and possess a strong thermocline with limited 
vertical mixing typically have high  sea- surface Δ14cSw values. conversely, subpolar gyres and areas 
of divergence and upwelling bring older, more negative Δ14cSw waters to mix at the surface. In 
the Paciic, maximal Δ14c values occur in midlatitudes around 30° north and south; at the peak, 
these regions registered 210‰ or 260‰ above prebomb levels, whereas equatorial waters reached 
50‰ or 110‰ above prebomb levels (linick 1978). These Δ14cSw surface patterns translate down 
through the mixed layer, although values drop off quickly below that and remain relatively constant 
below about 1000 m in all areas (Key et al. 2004). The vertical Δ14cSw gradients observed in the 
North Paciic and North atlantic may potentially be used as a depth tracer in the context of animal 
movements if the analysed tissue is primarily derived from DIc (Pearcy & Stuiver 1983, Rau et al. 
1986). Upwelling can cause signiicant variability in  sea- surface Δ14cSw values on regional and 
seasonal scales (Figure 5). For instance, strong upwelling around the galapagos Islands brings old

‘dead’ carbon up from depth that signiicantly reduces regional surface Δ14c values (Druffel 1981). 
Similarly, the South makassar Strait in Indonesia exhibits signiicant seasonal variability, in the 
range of 10‰ to 20‰ seasonally, associated with upwelling that overlays the interannual trend of 
increasing Δ14c value with time after the initial bomb spike (Fallon & guilderson 2008).
Nitrogen isotopes
Nitrogen isotope fractionation
although only a small fraction of the global nitrogen reservoir is contained in living matter, organic 
nitrogen is of tremendous importance for nitrogen isotope distributions because almost all nitrogen 
isotope fractionation results from metabolically related processes (Hübner 1986). Fractionation asso-
ciated with nitrogen ixation is typically small, with the average isotope effect between atmospheric 
N2 and ixed nitrogen near 0‰ (Hoering & Ford 1960, Fogel & cifuentes 1993). mineralization of 
organic matter to ammonium also has a relatively small fractionation factor (0‰ ± 1‰), but con-
current nitriication of ammonium to nitrate, particularly in vent and seep environments with high 
concentrations of ammonium, can result in large fractionations (–18‰ to –42‰) (Hoch et al. 1992, 
Fogel & cifuentes 1993). assimilation of NH4
+, NO2
–, and NO3
– by microorganisms can cause 
signiicant and often highly variable fractionation (–27‰ to 0‰), regulated by nitrogen availability 
and reaction rates (Fogel & cifuentes 1993). Denitriication produces N2 gas, which if lost to the 
atmosphere by diffusional processes can produce large isotope effects owing to classic Rayleigh 
fractionation (as discussed previously). Denitriication produces N2 gas that can be upwards of 40‰ 
lower in δ15N relative to dissolved nitrate, leaving the remaining nitrate relatively 15N-enriched 
(cline & Kaplan 1975).
Nitrogen isotope geographic variability
The δ15N of nitrogenous species in seawater is determined by the balance of nitrogen sources and 
sinks, as well as fractionation resulting from biologically mediated processes. Sources of nitrogen 
to the marine environment include river  run- off, atmospheric deposition, and N2 ixation by cyano-
bacteria, while the major sinks are burial in sediments and denitriication. The atlantic and Paciic 
Oceans both show  large- scale, albeit opposite, geographic relationships between δ15N of plankton 
(δ15NPlK) and latitude (Figure 7). a  meta- analysis of published zooplankton δ15NPlK values from 
the upper ocean of the North atlantic shows a pattern of enrichment with increasing latitude. The 
lowest δ15NPlK values are found in the oligotrophic gyres, particularly the Sargasso Sea, where 
diazotrophic cyanobacteria ix N2 (0‰) into organic nitrogen (montoya et al. 2002). δ15NPlK values 
increase with increasing latitude as NO3
– (5‰) becomes the major ixed nitrogen source for marine 
phytoplankton. In the Paciic Ocean, however, the δ15 NPlK- latitude correlation is reversed, with 
the highest δ15NPlK values recorded in the eastern tropical and central gyre (Saino & Hattori 1987). 
This is because (1) the Paciic is generally iron limited and thus lacks signiicant N2 ixation in the 
surface ocean and (2)  year- round stratiication and large oxygen minimum zones result in signiicant 
amounts of denitriication and thus nitrate 15N enrichment (Saino & Hattori 1987). For example, 
the δ15N of dissolved nitrate in antarctic Intermediate water can be upwards of 12.5‰ lower than 
that of active denitriication zones in the North Paciic Ocean (cline & Kaplan 1975). Particulate 
organic matter decomposition and respiration, resulting in faster losses in 14N, can create a gradient 
of increased δ15N with depth in the ocean (Saino & Hattori 1980). This is particularly evident over 
areas of high productivity, where large diatoms at the base of the euphotic zone may substantially 
affect vertical δ15N gradients (Kalansky et al. 2011).
There can also be signiicant variability in δ15N values on smaller spatial scales. anthropogenic 
sources of nitrogen, including fertilizers, sewage and agricultural animal waste, and atmo-
spheric deposition via fossil fuel burning, are all important point sources that can have a signiicant

339
impact on coastal δ15NPOm (Heaton 1986). For instance, sewage discharge into coastal estuaries 
has provided enriched δ15N isotopic point sources due to isotope fractionation during treatment, 
which is relected in the δ15N values of resident organisms (Hansson et al. 1997, Dierking et al. 
2012). Similarly, excess nutrients in wastewater associated with diffuse source anthropogenic activ-
ities, such as urban  run- off and lawn/ ield fertilization, have led to eutrophication in coastal bays 
(mcclelland et al. 1997). This can result in an increase in primary production and subsequent deni-
triication, both of which also provide an enriched δ15N isotopic signal that is relected in the tissue 
δ15N values of local ishes and invertebrates (grifin & valiela 2001).
Plankton δ15NPlK values can also vary temporally, particularly on seasonal timescales, due 
to changes in primary productivity associated with shifts in nutrient sources and concentrations, 
microbial nitrogen cycling and phytoplankton species growth rates and composition (cifuentes 
et al. 1988, goering et al. 1990, Ostrom et al. 1997, vizzini & mazzola 2003). Seasonal changes 
in δ15N at the base of food webs (δ15Nbase) can be quite large. cifuentes et al. (1988) found that the 
δ15N value of suspended particulate matter in the Delaware Estuary in winter alone ranged from 
+5.5‰ to +12.2‰. The authors observed δ15N values as low as +2.3‰ in early spring, and just 
3 weeks later, a δ15N maximum of +18.7‰ was located in the central portion of the estuary. This 
large seasonal variability was associated with seasonal shifts in available nitrogen sources, as NH4
+ 
utilization far exceeded NO3
– in the winter, and with increases in productivity and decreases in 
nutrient availability during the spring bloom. large shifts in baseline stable isotope values will have 
a cascading effect on upper trophic levels. as a result, seasonal variation must be considered when 
constructing and using isoscapes to address questions of connectivity and trophic dynamics in the 
marine environment.
Oxygen isotopes
Oxygen isotope fractionation
Fractionation of oxygen isotopes is temperature dependent (Urey 1947, gat 1996), and δ18O anal-
yses of marine carbonates have routinely been used as a proxy for temperature in both palaeo- 
and modern applications (aharon 1991, Fairbanks et al. 1997, Thorrold et al. 1997). However, this

 temperature- dependent fractionation effect is small (~0.2‰°c–1) relative to the processes of evapo-
ration and precipitation that control ocean  basin- scale variation in seawater δ18O values (δ18Osw). 
Rayleigh distillation plays an important role in determining the fractionation of oxygen isotopes in 
the hydrologic cycle (gat 1996). These processes are largely the same as those regulating hydrogen 
isotopes, which can be seen in the meteoric water line (mwl):
 
δ2H = 8*δ18O + d,
where d is the ‘deuterium excess’ (d = 10‰ for the global mwl; Dansgaard 1964). as a result, δ18O 
values of seawater exhibit geographic variation in the world’s oceans that typically covary with 
deuterium and salinity.
many calciied tissues, including otoliths (Kalish 1991a, Thorrold et al. 1997), bones (Barrick 
et al. 1992), teeth (Kolodny et al. 1983), and shells (mook & vogel 1968) are precipitated in oxygen 
isotope equilibrium with ambient water. Some biogenic carbonates, however, exhibit kinetic effects 
that result in δ18O values out of equilibrium with ambient water (mcconnaughey 1989a,b).
Oxygen isotope geographic variability
Oxygen isotope values of ocean water on regional,  short- term spatiotemporal scales can relect a 
mass balance between evaporation E, precipitation P, advection A, mixing M, and river  run- off R 
(Figure 8), which can be modelled as (Benway & mix 2004)

values that are most negative are found at high latitudes (nearly –20‰ in the arctic Ocean) and 
regions of extensive freshwater input. Freshwater discharge lowers δ18OSw values of coastal ocean 
waters and, in the case of large rivers like the amazon and the Orinoco in the tropics and the 
macKenzie and Ob in the arctic, can produce anomalously low δ18OSw values that penetrate hun-
dreds of kilometres into the ocean (e.g., cooper et al. 2005).
There are several notable exceptions to the general pattern of decreasing δ18OSw values with 
latitude. advection of 18 O- depleted subpolar water towards the equator via the california current 
results in anomalously low δ18OSw values along the eastern boundary of the North Paciic Ocean. 
conversely, advection of 18 O- enriched  low- latitude water via the gulf Stream causes the western 
boundary of the North atlantic to have relatively high δ18OSw values for its latitude. vertical proiles 
of δ18O trend towards 0‰ with depth and typically show less variation than the horizontal isoscapes 
(Schmidt et al. 1999).
Sulphur isotopes
Sulphur isotope fractionation
major sources of sulphur in the marine environment include hydrothermal processes and riverine 
input. Removal of sulphur in the marine environment is mostly through evaporite deposits, pyrite 
or organic compound burial and formation of carbonate compounds (Bottrell & Newton 2006). 
Sulphate is the most common and biologically available species of sulphur in the open ocean. The 
fractionation of sulphate between minerals and dissolved sulphate is approximately zero; therefore, 
neither the creation nor the dissolution of evaporites has a signiicant effect on sulphate δ34S values. 
Bacterial sulphate reduction, which takes place in sediments and other anoxic environments, is the 
major source of biological fractionation of sulphur in the marine environment (Bottrell & Newton 
2006), resulting in a 30‰ to 70‰ isotope effect (Peterson & Fry 1987). Bacterial sulphate reduction 
is a kinetic process that produces sulphides and organic matter that are depleted in 34S relative to 
the sulphate being reduced. Rainwater sulphates are also potential sources of sulphur for intertidal 
plants (Fry et al. 1982). The equilibrium between oxidized and reduced sulphur species is typically 
only found at very high temperatures, characteristic of hydrothermal vent systems (Krouse et al. 1988).
The δ34S values of phytoplankton, upland plants and marsh grasses are often quite distinct 
because of their use of different sources of inorganic sulphur (Peterson et al. 1985). marine phyto-
plankton and seaweeds utilize marine sulphate (21‰; Rees et al. 1978) and fractionate it little 
during uptake and assimilation into organic sulphur compounds. Upland plants in aerobic soils 
also fractionate sulphate little during uptake and assimilation, but they obtain sulphate from pre-
cipitation with a lower δ34S value (2‰ to 8‰). marsh plants and other primary producers living in 
anoxic conditions often use sulphides with much lower δ34S values for at least some of their sulphur 
requirements, resulting in organic matter that is equally depleted in 34S. The δ34S signal established 
by primary producers is passed on to higher trophic levels in the food web because the essential 
 sulphur- bearing compounds are typically incorporated into consumer tissues with little to no tro-
phic fractionation (Peterson et al. 1986, Florin et al. 2011, but see Tanz & Schmidt 2010).
Sulphur isotope geographic variability
Sulphur isotope distributions in the marine environment vary with distribution of sulphides and 
sulphates, quality of growing conditions (aerobic versus anaerobic), atmospheric deposition from 
natural sources and point sources from pollution. The residence time of sulphate in seawater is 
2 × 107 years; thus, sulphate is well mixed in the marine environment, maintaining a relatively 
constant δ34SSw value of 21‰ throughout the open ocean (Rees et al. 1978). In general, benthic 
and nearshore habitats, including estuaries and marshes, are typically more anoxic than pelagic, 
offshore ecosystems and thus experience elevated levels of sulphate reduction with correspondingly 

[Page 16]
KElTON w. mcmaHON, lI lINg HamaDy & SImON R. THORROlD
342
higher δ34SSw sulphate values. There can be times when ocean sulphate values do change signii-
cantly. For example, during periods of intense weathering, particularly of shales, ocean sulphate 
δ34S can decrease signiicantly. conversely, anoxic zones, such as parts of the Black Sea and regions 
of high primary productivity, may experience increased ocean sulphate δ34SSw values due to ele-
vated bacterial sulphate reduction (Neretin et al. 2003). On geological timescales, the isotope com-
position of seawater sulphate varies from 10‰ to 33‰ as a result of changes in the magnitude of 
sulphur luxes into and out of the marine environment as well as changes in the isotope fractionation 
between sulphate and buried sulphide (Peterson & Fry 1987). The δ34S value of terrestrial sulphur is 
highly variable and dependent on rock type and  climate- dependent weathering patterns (Krouse & 
grinenko 1991). The δ34S value of river water sulphate (global mean 7‰) varies regionally accord-
ing to bedrock lithology, anthropogenic inputs and atmospheric deposition from natural sources 
(Thode et al. 1961). as a result, terrestrial  run- off, rivers and groundwater inputs can be major 
sources of coastal δ34S variability. Sulphur isotopes are thus most useful in coastal and estuarine 
environments, where highly variable freshwater inputs mix with relatively constant marine values 
to create steep gradients in sulphate δ34S (Peterson & Fry 1987, Fry 2002).
 Human- induced perturbations to the natural sulphur cycle have markedly increased since indus-
trialization, and the majority of sulphur emitted into the atmosphere is now likely of anthropogenic 
origin (Peterson & Fry 1987). anthropogenic sources of sulphur, most notably from fossil fuel 
burning, can overwhelm natural variability on small scales. These sources can produce unique point 
sources to track movement and residence patterns in the marine environment. In addition, eutrophi-
cation as a result of sewage inputs to coastal habitats can promote anoxic conditions, which support 
sulphate reduction and the generation of  low- δ34S sulphides.
Minor and trace elements in calciied tissues
The chemical composition of oceanic minerals has been used to determine environmental condi-
tions in  palaeo- oceans for decades (Kastner 1999). more recently, ocean ecogeochemistry applica-
tions have focused on inferring movement patterns of ish and invertebrates from the elemental 
chemistry of aragonitic otoliths, shells and statoliths (e.g., campana et al. 1999, Zacherl et al. 2003a, 
arkhipkin et al. 2004, Becker et al. 2005, Elsdon et al. 2008, walther & limburg 2012). while a 
number of elements are found in biogenic aragonite, most researchers to date have focused on some 
combination of six elements that both substitute for calcium in the aragonite matrix (and there-
fore are more likely to record ambient dissolved concentrations) and are suficiently abundant and 
free from isobaric interferences to allow for quantiication using inductively coupled plasma mass 
spectrometry (Thorrold & Swearer 2009). These elements are characterized by  conservative- type 
(lithium, magnesium, strontium),  nutrient- type (barium) and  scavenged- type (manganese, lead) dis-
tributions in the oceans and are most usefully reported as ratios to calcium in both ambient waters 
and in the calciied tissues.
Minor and trace element fractionation
minor and trace element composition of calciied tissues are correlated with ambient dissolved 
concentrations in at least some instances. For instance, concentrations of strontium and barium 
in otoliths (Bath et al. 2000, Elsdon & gillanders 2004, Dorval et al. 2007) and gastropod pro-
toconchs (Zacherl et al. 2003b) appear to relect environmental parameters and serve as valuable 
tracers of juvenile movements and larval dispersal, respectively. However, strontium, barium and 
indeed almost all metals, with the notable exception of manganese (Elsdon & gillanders 2003), 
are found at signiicantly lower concentrations in calciied tissues than in the ambient environment 
(campana & Thorrold 2001). This fractionation is primarily controlled by biological processes 
that occur during ion transport from seawater to the internal luid from which the calciied tissue

precipitates (e.g., melancon et al. 2009). Ion exchange across intestinal or gill membranes, ionic 
exchange between blood plasma and endolymph and the partition coeficients of ions at the otolith 
growth surface all likely play some role in regulating the composition of the precipitating luid 
(Kalish 1991b).
Temperature typically has a positive inluence on Sr:ca in  low- strontium aragonite in ish oto-
liths and mollusc protoconchs (Bath et al. 2000, Elsdon & gillanders 2002, Zacherl et al. 2003b) 
and a negative effect on Sr:ca in  high- strontium aragonite, including coral skeletons and mollusc 
statoliths (Beck et al. 1992, Zacherl et al. 2003b, cohen & Thorrold 2007). The effects of tem-
perature on barium, manganese and magnesium are more variable and less conclusive (Elsdon & 
gillanders 2002, Zacherl et al. 2003b, martin & Thorrold 2005); a recent study found that the li:ca 
ratio was positively correlated with temperature in the otolith of the latish Solea solea (Tanner 
et al. 2013).
Minor and trace element geographic variability
The long residence times of conservative elements leads to generally uniform distributions through-
out the world’s oceans. For instance, lithium has a residence time of 1.5 million years and a global 
li:ca ratio of about 2.5 mmol mol–1 (Huh et al. 1998). Dissolved lithium values in river waters are 
considerably more variable and generally lower than in seawater, ranging from 30 nM to 11.7 μM, 
with concomitant li:ca ratios ranging from 77.8 μmol mol–1 to 15.7 mmol mol–1 (Huh et al. 1998). 
a signiicant correlation between otolith li:ca and salinity suggests that lithium may be a useful 
tracer of movement between marine and freshwater habitats (Hicks et al. 2010), although the range 
of potential values in river waters means that freshwater end members would need to be character-
ized irst. magnesium is also conservative in seawater with a mean mg:ca value of 5.14 mol mol–1 
(Bruland & lohan 2004). Riverine water ratios are almost invariably lower than that of seawater. 
with a global average value for freshwater of 0.45 mol mol–1, mg:ca ratios are potentially a useful 
tracer of salinity (Surge & lohmann 2002). Finally, the global seawater Sr:ca ratio is approximately 
8.5 mmol mol–1 (de villiers 1999) and is relatively invariant throughout the oceans. Dissolved stron-
tium values in freshwater are largely controlled by surrounding bedrock geological composition, 
both rock type and weathering eficiency, and are often nearly an order of magnitude lower than 
seawater values (Bricker & Jones 1995, limburg 1995, capo et al. 1998). Freshwater values show 
signiicant geographic and temporal variability, with Sr:ca ratios ranging from 0.27 to 19.18 mmol 
mol–1 (Brown & Severin 2009). Strontium isotope values in ocean waters are relatively invariant 
with 87Sr:86Sr = 0.70918 (ando et al. 2010), while luvial 87Sr:86Sr ratios typically vary from about 
0.704 in basaltic drainages to at least 0.75 in older, highly radiogenic granites ( Barnett- Johnson et al. 
2010, muhlfeld et al. 2012). Biological fractionation of strontium isotopes is minimal; therefore, 
87Sr:86Sr ratios represent an excellent tracer of movements between freshwater and ocean environ-
ments (mcmahon et al. 2013).
Barium follows a  nutrient- type distribution in seawater, with typical surface ocean values of 
0.01 to 0.02 μM, increasing to 0.03 and 0.09 μM at a depth of 3000 m in the North atlantic and 
North Paciic, respectively (Bruland & lohan 2004). Barium concentrations in riverine and coastal 
areas are relatively high compared to slope and oceanic waters (Shen & Stanford 1990), varying by 
nearly an order of magnitude globally around a worldwide riverine average of 0.10 μM (gaillardet 
et al. 2003). Upwelling of cold,  nutrient- rich deep water can be a signiicant secondary source of 
relatively high barium concentrations to the ocean surface waters (lea et al. 1989).
Both manganese and lead are scavenged elements characterized by strong interactions with 
particles that lead to very short oceanic residence times of less than 1000 years (Donat & Bruland 
1995). atmospheric dust is a major source of manganese and lead in oceanic environments. For 
example, peak concentrations of dissolved manganese in North atlantic Ocean surface waters occur 
at 20° north, which coincides with the zone of maximum dust deposition from the Sahara Desert

(Bergquist & Boyle 2006). However, in estuarine settings, manganese and lead luxes from porewa-
ters often overwhelm atmospheric and luvial inputs ( Rivera- Duarte & Flegal 1994, warnken et al. 
2001). The vertical distributions of dissolved manganese in both the Paciic and the atlantic Ocean 
are characterized by a surface maximum driven by atmospheric deposition and photoreduction of 
manganese oxides (Sunda & Huntsman 1988), a subsurface minimum and a second maximum coin-
cident with the oxygen minimum layer and presumably generated by redox dissolution (landing & 
Bruland 1987, Boye et al. 2012). most of the dissolved lead in the oceans comes from anthropogenic 
sources, in particular from the use of leaded gasoline in the United States and Europe (Boyle 2001). 
The introduction of leaded gasoline in the 1920s led to a marked increase in dissolved lead levels 
in surface waters of the North atlantic and, to a lesser extent, the North Paciic that peaked in the 
early 1970s. This lead spike provided a dated marker that was recorded in the skeletons of corals in 
Bermuda (Shen & Boyle 1987), sclerosponges in the Bahamas (Swart et al. 2002), and bivalve shells 
in the North atlantic ( Krause- Nehring et al. 2012).
Previous studies have found little variation in manganese, strontium and barium concentrations 
from estuarine waters on monthly to seasonal timescales. However, water chemistry in dynamic 
environments with large tidal ranges may vary over shorter daily or tidal scales (Dorval & Jones 
2005, Elsdon & gillanders 2006). For example, Elsdon & gillanders (2006) found signiicant dif-
ferences in manganese, strontium and barium concentrations between water samples collected on 
different days within three small (<10 km) tidal estuaries that accounted for up to 64% of the total 
variation on scales of days, weeks, months and seasons.
Biological tissues
Ecogeochemistry rests fundamentally on the assumption that the composition of a tissue will relect 
the isotopic or elemental composition of the source from which an element is obtained and some 
degree of fractionation (Tieszen et al. 1983, gannes et al. 1997). In the previous section, we dis-
cussed the processes that create geographic variability in stable isotope and trace element values 
and the resulting isoscapes. In this section, we address the issues of constraining  tissue- speciic iso-
tope turnover rates and discrimination factors that control the offset between the baseline isoscape 
and the consumer isotope or element values.
Element turnover rates
Isotope turnover rate plays an important role in determining the temporal scales over which a tissue 
records an isotopic signature of residence or diet (Dalerum & angerbjörn 2005). Isotope turnover 
rates can vary from hours to years depending on a number of factors, including tissue type, the 
metabolic turnover or growth rate, and the taxa studied (Boecklen et al. 2011). analysis of faeces 
or gut contents provides  short- term information about an organism’s diet, ranging from hours for 
zooplankton to a few days for large mammals. more metabolically active tissues, including liver 
and blood, typically have faster turnover rates (weeks) than less metabolically active tissues, such 
as muscle (months) or bone (years) (Tieszen et al. 1983, Buchheister & latour 2009,  malpica- cruz 
et al. 2011). Similarly, the isotope composition of whole tissues represents an integration of the 
isotopic values of the tissue’s constituents (e.g., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates), each with character-
istic turnover rates that may differ from the bulk tissue turnover rate.
Tissues that are metabolically inert after formation, including hair, baleen, claws and otoliths, 
preserve a permanent record of source isotope composition (Rubenstein & Hobson 2004). calciied, 
accretionary tissues with density or optical bands corresponding to daily, seasonal or annual 
patterns, including otoliths, bivalve shells, teeth, claws, scales, vertebrae and baleen, may also pro-
vide a chronological record of lifetime animal diet and movement (Richardson 1988, Schell et al. 
1989, campana & Thorrold 2001, campana et al. 2002). Otoliths are particularly valuable tissues 

[Page 19]
OcEaN EcOgEOcHEmISTRy: a REvIEw
345
for retrospective studies of diet and movement because they grow continuously through succes-
sive addition of daily and annual aragonitic growth bands on a proteinaceous matrix, and they are 
metabolically inert postdeposition (Degens et al. 1969, campana & Neilson 1985, campana 1999). 
Otoliths therefore preserve a chronological record of a ish’s metabolic activity and the physical 
and chemical characteristics of the water in which the ish resided during the time of deposition 
(Thorrold et al. 1997). Researchers have similarly used the elemental composition of other calciied 
tissues, including bivalve (Becker et al. 2007) and gastropod shells (Zacherl et al. 2003a), elasmo-
branch vertebrae (Hale et al. 2006, Tillett et al. 2011), and squid statoliths (arkhipkin et al. 2004), 
to determine movement patterns during speciic  life- history stages of a number of marine species.
Element turnover rate also varies by taxon. a literature review by Boecklen et al. (2011) found 
signiicant variation in  tissue- speciic carbon turnover rates among taxa. For example, the isotopic 
 half- life (time for a tissue isotope value to change halfway from initial to its new equilibrium value) 
of muscle in mammals (1 to 3 months) was considerably longer than that for ish (2 to 8 weeks) and 
birds (1 to 3 weeks). One mechanism generating differences in isotope turnover rate among taxa 
can be seen in relative contributions of metabolic turnover rate and growth rate to isotope turnover 
rate in teleost ishes and elasmobranchs. Isotope turnover rates tend to be strongly correlated with 
growth rate and accretion of biomass in teleost ishes (Herzka 2005, logan et al. 2006). Fish that 
are growing quickly (often during early  life- history stages) tend to reach isotopic equilibrium with 
their diet much faster than older,  slower- growing ish (Herzka 2005). conversely, in elasmobranchs 
isotopic turnover rate appears to be closely linked to metabolic turnover rate (logan & lutcavage 
2010,  malpica- cruz et al. 2011).
Trophic discrimination factors
we deine trophic discrimination between diet and consumer to include kinetic fractionation associ-
ated with enzymatic reactions during metabolism as well as differences in stable isotope values due 
to differences in tissue composition. as with isotope turnover rate, trophic discrimination can vary 
widely among tissue types (gannes et al. 1997, vander Zanden & Rasmussen 2001, mccutchan 
et al. 2003, Olive et al. 2003). In this section, we focus primarily on bulk trophic discrimination 
of carbon (Δ13c) and nitrogen (Δ15N) between diet and consumer as they are the primary elements 
used to assess trophic dynamics in ecogeochemistry studies. However, it is important to note that 
other elements undergo varying degrees of trophic discrimination. For example, sulphur isotopes 
exhibit little or no trophic discrimination; thus, δ34S values of consumers relect the baseline signa-
tures (Peterson et al. 1986). There are mixed results regarding the degree of trophic discrimination 
(Δ2H) in  non- exchangable hydrogen. Some studies report signiicant differences between diet and 
consumer δ2H values, suggesting some degree of trophic fractionation (macko et al. 1983, Birchall 
et al. 2005). However, other studies found that trophic fractionation was negligible and suggested 
that some  non- exchangeable hydrogen in consumer tissue may come from ingestion or diffusion 
from ambient water (Solomon et al. 2009).
marine carbon is typically thought to be conservatively fractionated (Δ13c = 0‰ to 1‰) as it 
continues to move through food webs (DeNiro & Epstein 1978). This small trophic discrimination 
is the basis for using δ13c to track diet sources and carbon low through food webs as well as migra-
tion among isotopically distinct habitats (see reviews by Hobson 1999, Kelly 2000, Rubenstein 
& Hobson 2004). However, there can be signiicant variability in Δ13c, from –3‰ to 5‰, among 
tissues and taxa owing to differential digestion or fractionation during assimilation and metabolic 
processing (vander Zanden & Rasmussen 2001, Post 2002, mccutchan et al. 2003). Trophic dis-
crimination is typically larger for animals with higher rates of respiration relative to growth, such 
as birds and mammals, compared to ish and invertebrates. In addition, herbivores that must convert 
plant biomass into animal biomass often have higher bulk Δ13c values than carnivores and omni-
vores (Elsdon et al. 2010). The form of excreted waste may also affect trophic discrimination, as

urea and uric acid contain carbon, while ammonia does not (however, this concept has received 
greater attention for its effects on Δ15N, discussed separately below). analysing whole tissues often 
results in larger  diet- to- consumer Δ13c values compared to muscle due to the inclusion of lipids dur-
ing  whole- body analysis. For example,  malpica- cruz et al. (2011) found signiicant differences in 
 tissue- speciic Δ13c values for  laboratory- reared leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata). liver, which 
had the highest lipid content, showed the lowest Δ13c values, ins and cartilage had the highest Δ13c 
values, and muscle and blood were intermediate. This variability can pose a signiicant confound-
ing variable when comparing δ13c values from large consumers, typically analysed as muscle, and 
small consumers, which are often analysed whole.
The isotope value of consumer tissue may not always follow bulk diet isotope values, causing 
further complications for the interpretation of bulk stable isotope data in an ecogeochemistry con-
text. much of the variability among  tissue- speciic trophic discrimination factors is attributed to 
differences in tissue composition and lipid content ( malpica- cruz et al. 2011). The carbon skeletons 
of different dietary components (proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates), which are often isotopically 
distinct from each other, can be routed to different tissue constituents in a process termed isotopic 
routing (Schwarcz 1991). Several studies have emphasized the problems that isotopic routing poses 
to the interpretation of bulk stable isotope data in diet reconstructions (Parkington 1991, Schwarcz 
& Schoeninger 1991, ambrose & Norr 1993, Elsdon et al. 2010, mcmahon et al. 2010). Studies have 
shown that changes in amino acid and lipid composition among tissues or ontogenetically within 
tissues can obscure changes in δ13c associated with diet or location shifts (watabe et al. 1982, 
murayama 2000, Hüssy et al. 2004). To control for tissue composition differences, it is often desir-
able to analyse the same tissue type across all samples. This is not always possible, particularly for 
large food web reconstructions that may require analysing a wide range of tissues.
another common, although often debated, practice used to control for tissue composition differ-
ences is to normalize tissue lipid content, through either chemical extraction or mathematical cor-
rection (Post et al. 2007, logan et al. 2008, Boecklen et al. 2011). while the change in δ13c values 
with lipid removal is expected, chemical extraction often affects nitrogen isotope values as well 
(Sotiropoulos et al. 2004, logan et al. 2008). given that most lipids do not contain nitrogen, these 
indings indicate that we do not fully understand the changes in tissue composition that occur during 
chemical lipid extraction. Several mathematical models have been developed to correct  non- lipid 
extracted tissue isotope values for lipid contribution a posteriori (Post et al. 2007, logan et al. 
2008). most models use elemental  carbon- to- nitrogen ratios (c:N) of bulk tissue as a proxy for 
lipid content and a  protein- lipid δ13c discrimination factor (Sweeting et al. 2006, Post et al. 2007). 
However, these parameters are not well constrained and may vary among species or higher taxa, 
resulting in a large range in the predictive power of the approach (0.25 < R2 < 0.96) (Post et al. 2007, 
logan et al. 2008, Tarroux et al. 2010).
Nitrogen isotopes typically exhibit a 3‰ to 4‰ trophic discrimination (Δ15N) between diet and 
consumer (DeNiro & Epstein 1981, minagawa & wada 1984). This enrichment stems from a combi-
nation of fractionation during assimilation and protein synthesis as well as the preferential excretion 
of light isotopes as waste during metabolism (see review by Kelly 2000). as with carbon, there can 
be signiicant variability in trophic discrimination around the commonly accepted mean. Estimates 
of Δ15N range from –1‰ to 9‰ as a function of dietary protein content, consumer species, tissue 
type, physiological stress and biochemical form of nitrogenous waste (see reviews by minagawa & 
wada 1984, michener & Schell 1994, vander Zanden & Rasmussen 2001, mccutchan et al. 2003, 
vanderklift & Ponsard 2003). For instance, animals feeding on  high- protein diets often exhibit 
signiicantly higher Δ15N values compared to those feeding on  low- protein diets (vander Zanden & 
Rasmussen 2001). Thus, diet quality and composition can have a signiicant impact on Δ15N values 
within and among taxa. vanderklift & Ponsard (2003) reviewed nitrogen trophic discrimination in 
animals with a variety of forms of nitrogen excretion (e.g., ammonia, urea, uric acid). They found 
that animals excreting urea typically exhibited signiicantly larger mean trophic discrimination

347
factors (Δ15N = 3‰) than  ammonia- excreting animals (2‰). many ureoletic elasmobranchs show 
relatively low Δ15N values of 1‰ to 2‰ (Hüssy et al. 2010,  malpica- cruz et al. 2011), although this 
pattern is not ubiquitous (logan & lutcavage 2010). These examples illustrate the complex contri-
butions of the bulk trophic discrimination of nitrogen isotopes.
Nitrogen isotopes are commonly used to calculate the trophic position of consumers in the 
marine environment. The simplest model for calculating trophic position TP using bulk SIa is 
as follows:
 
TP bulk  = λ + (δ15Ncon – δ15Nbase)/Δ15N,
where δ15Ncon is the nitrogen isotope value of the consumer, δ15Nbase is the nitrogen isotope value 
of the baseline consumer, λ is the trophic position of the baseline consumer, and Δ15N is the tro-
phic discrimination between diet and consumer. Typically, δ15Ncon is measured directly, and Δ15N 
is assumed to be between 3‰ and 4‰, despite the large range discussed previously. choosing a 
suitable δ15Nbase is one of the most challenging, and thus limiting, factors in trophic estimation using 
bulk SIa. There can be signiicant temporal variability in δ15N base associated with the typically 
much faster turnover rates and thus shorter integration times of basal food web components relative 
to  longer- lived consumers in the upper trophic level (Hannides et al. 2009). In marine environments, 
the microalgae that support marine food webs typically have δ15N values that change spatially and 
seasonally due to incomplete utilization of nitrogenous nutrients (altabet & Francois 2001, lourey 
et al. 2003) and differential utilization of nitrogen sources (nitrate, ammonium, N2) in space and 
time (Dugdale & goering 1967, Dore et al. 2002). additional complications arise when organisms 
feed in multiple food webs with different δ15Nbase sources. as was the case for bulk δ13c interpreta-
tions, differences in tissue composition and metabolic processing can make interpreting bulk δ15N 
values challenging. For instance, Schmidt et al. (2004) found that variability in bulk δ15N values 
between euphausiid sexes and tissues (digestive glands and abdominal muscle) were driven by dif-
ferences in the relative proportions of amino acids (up to 5 mol%) and their δ15N variability (up to 
11‰), as well as differences in tissue metabolism, primarily protein synthesis and degradation for 
energy supply. The authors showed that, despite the offset in bulk δ15N values between female and 
male euphausiids (1.3‰), both sexes were in fact feeding at the same trophic level, and the tissue 
composition and metabolism differences actually confound  trophic- level interpretations of bulk 
δ15N values.
One of the biggest challenges of interpreting bulk tissue stable isotope values is the confounding 
effect of changes in trophic position with variations in isotope values at the base of the food web 
(δ13cbase and δ15Nbase; Post 2002). It can be dificult to determine whether changes in a consumer’s 
stable isotope value are due to changes in its diet or trophic position, changes in the baseline food 
web stable isotope value, or both. This can be particularly problematic when studying the diet and 
movement of highly migratory marine organisms that may change diet and trophic position as well 
as habitats throughout ontogeny (graham et al. 2010, mcmahon et al. 2013). The factors described 
can make interpretations of bulk tissue SIa challenging for studies of diet and migration. as a 
result, there have been calls for more studies to examine the biochemical and physiological basis 
of stable isotope ratios in ecology (gannes et al. 1997, gannes et al. 1998, Karasov & martínez del 
Rio 2007).
 Compound- speciic stable isotope analysis
Thanks in large part to advances in mass spectrometry, including gas chromatograph/ combustion/ 
isotope ratio  monitoring- mass spectrometry (gc/ c/ irm- mS) (merritt et al. 1994,  meier- augenstein 
1999, Sessions 2006) and more recently the Finnigan lc Isolink (mccullagh et al. 2006) and 
moving wire interface (Krummen et al. 2004, Sessions et al. 2005), it is now possible to obtain

precise and accurate stable isotope measurements from individual biological compounds, including 
amino acids and fatty acids.  compound- speciic SIa has the potential to increase the speciicity 
of ecogeochemistry studies signiicantly and avoid many of the confounding variables that make 
it challenging to interpret bulk stable isotope values. Speciically, the metabolic and physiological 
processes that affect the isotopic values of individual compounds are better constrained and often 
better understood than the numerous variables affecting bulk tissue stable isotope values. while 
fractionation between bulk compounds is typically in the range of 1‰ to 5‰, fractionation between 
individual amino acids can be greater than 20‰ (macko et al. 1987, Keil & Fogel 2001, mcmahon 
et al. 2010). while the use of  compound- speciic SIa in the marine environment is still relatively 
new, the technique has been applied to a variety of tissues, including blood, muscle, bone, and 
otoliths, to assess changes in diet and habitat use (Hare et al. 1991, Popp et al. 2007, lorrain et al. 
2009, mcmahon et al. 2011a,b). In the following sections, we discuss the processes that result in 
fractionation of individual compounds (amino acids and fatty acids). we also highlight several key 
advantages of  compound- speciic SIa for ecogeochemistry studies, as well as current limitations 
and the direction of the ield.
Amino acids
Carbon
amino acids have conventionally been classiied into two categories with regard to carbon metabo-
lism, essential (indispensable) and  non- essential (dispensable), relating to their synthesis by various 
organisms (Table 2). Borman et al. (1946) termed as indispensable those amino acids that cannot 
be synthesized by an organism from materials normally available to the cells at a speed adequate 
with the demands for normal growth. However, this deinition emphasizes that there will be some 
variability in how amino acids are parsed into each category depending on the metabolic capabili-
ties and demands of the organism. There are nine amino acids that are classiied as truly essen-
tial, meaning that while plants and bacteria can synthesize them de novo, animals have lost the

enzymatic pathways to synthesize these amino acids and thus must acquire them directly from diet. 
another seven amino acids are considered conditionally essential because their rate of synthesis is 
limited for certain species or conditions. Typically, the synthesis of these amino acids is limited by 
the availability of a precursor to donate carbon or accessory groups, such as sulphur. In some cases, 
synthesis is limited to certain tissues (e.g., proline and arginine in the intestines; wakabayashi 
et al. 1994) or by physiological demands (e.g., arginine as a precursor for ornithine used to detoxify 
ammonia in some carnivores; morris 1985).  Non- essential amino acids can be synthesized by all 
species in suficient quantities to maintain normal growth.
modest bulk tissue Δ13c values often relect  little- to- no trophic discrimination for all essential 
amino acids and relatively large trophic discrimination factors for many  non- essential amino acids 
(Hare et al. 1991, Howland et al. 2003, Jim et al. 2006, mcmahon et al. 2010) (Figure 9a). as a 
result, essential amino acid Δ13c values between diet and animal consumers are typically near 0‰. 
consumer essential amino acid δ13c values therefore represent the isotopic signature of primary 
producers at the base of the food web (δ13cbase) without the confounding variable of trophic dis-
crimination. The inherent metabolic diversity within and among prokaryotes and plants generates 
distinct patterns of essential amino acid δ13c values and proiles that can be used to identify the 
origin of amino acids even when there is considerable variability in bulk δ13c (abraham & Hesse 
2003, Scott et al. 2006). Unlike bulk SIa, which only relies on differences in δ13c value among end 
members,  compound- speciic SIa also makes use of differences in amino acid proiles, which can 
arise from different biosynthetic pathways used by various groups or from different isotope effects 
during the biosynthetic process. For example, plants and fungi have unique pathways for lysine 
and leucine biosynthesis, leading to isotopically distinct carbon isotope signatures compared to 
bacteria (Hagelstein et al. 1997, Hudson et al. 2005). larsen et al. (2009) showed that the isotopic 
difference between isoleucine and leucine was much larger for plants and fungi (6‰ to 12‰) than 
bacteria (–3‰ to 2‰), making them particularly valuable in distinguishing plant and fungal carbon 
from bacterially derived carbon. In contrast, the pathways for synthesis of alanine, valine, leu-
cine and isoleucine in the pyruvate family are similar across fungi, bacteria and plants (Hagelstein 
et al. 1997), and it is the  taxon- speciic isotope effects associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase that 
cause differential enrichment of pyruvate available for biosynthesis (Blair et al. 1985). amino acids 
in the pyruvate family can be useful for distinguishing the biosynthetic origin of amino acids in 
plants from fungi and bacteria (larsen et al. 2009). given the power of essential amino acid δ13c 
proiles to discriminate among key primary producers and the fact that those isotopic signatures 
are transferred to consumers at the upper trophic level with little to no trophic discrimination, 
 compound- speciic SIa provides a promising tool for identifying δ13cbase values to track animal 
movement through isotopically distinct food webs and to trace carbon low pathways in marine 
food webs.
mcmahon et al. (2011a,b) explored the potential for otolith amino acid geochemistry in snapper 
(family lutjanidae) to identify diet and residency patterns in juvenile nursery habitats. The technique 
relies on natural geographic variations in δ13c at the base of food webs among mangrove habitats, 
coral reefs and seagrass beds that are permanently recorded by otolith amino acids. mcmahon et al. 
(2011b) found that while bulk inorganic otolith δ13c and δ18O values differed signiicantly between 
snapper from  seagrass- dominated Red Sea coastal wetlands and the  mangrove- dominated sites on 
the Paciic coast of Panama, it failed to distinguish nursery residence on local scales. Essential 
amino acid δ13c values in otoliths, on the other hand, varied as a function of habitat type and pro-
vided a better tracer of residence in different juvenile nursery habitats than conventional bulk otolith 
SIa alone. By targeting individual amino acids, mcmahon et al. (2011b) avoided many of the con-
founding variables inherent in bulk otolith SIa, such as DIc masking dietary signatures. This study 
presented robust tracers of juvenile nursery residence that are crucial for reconstructing ontogenetic 
migration patterns of ishes among coastal wetlands and coral reefs. mcmahon et al. (2012) used 
a  compound- speciic ecogeochemistry approach to identify essential coral reef ish habitats and

connectivity within a tropical Red Sea seascape. The authors characterized unique δ13c signatures 
from ive potential juvenile nursery habitats by analysing ive essential amino acid δ13c values from 
a commercially and ecologically important snapper species, Lutjanus ehrenbergii. The authors then 
quantiied the relative contribution of coastal wetland and reef habitats to L. ehrenbergii popula-
tions on coastal, shelf, and oceanic coral reefs by classifying the juvenile core of adult ish otoliths 
to one of the ive potential nursery habitat signatures using the multivariate amino acid δ13c data. 
The results provided the irst direct measurements of the juvenile snappers’ remarkable migrations 
of over 30 km between nurseries and reefs. This study found that seascape coniguration played a 
critical but  heretofore- unrecognized role in determining connectivity among habitats.
The correlation between consumer essential amino acid δ13c value and the carbon isotope value 
at the base of the food web is not always predictable, particularly for consumers with an extensive 
microbial gut community. Newsome et al. (2011) conducted a controlled feeding experiment on Nile 
tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) reared on diets in which the percentage protein and δ13c value of 
macronutrients (protein, lipids and carbohydrates) varied signiicantly. The authors found that when 
tilapia were fed  high- protein diets, the δ13c values of their essential amino acids closely resembled 
those of their diet, as expected. However, in the  low- protein diet treatment, tilapia essential amino 
acid δ13c values were signiicantly higher than their corresponding dietary amino acids. This pattern 
indicated in vivo synthesis of essential amino acids from the bulk carbohydrate pool by microbes 
in the gut. The microbial contribution of essential macronutrients (vitamins and essential amino 
acids) to the host’s nutrition has been well studied in ruminants (Kung & Rode 1996, Karasov & 
carey 2008). It is becoming clear that  non- ruminant consumers may also rely on microbial gut con-
tributions under certain conditions. more research into the role of the gut microbial community in 
consumer amino acid metabolism is warranted, particularly for species such as sea turtles, dugongs 
and herbivorous ishes that are known to have extensive gut microbe communities (e.g., mountfort 
et al. 2002, andre et al. 2005).
 Non- essential amino acid Δ13c values often exhibit signiicant deviations from Δ13c = 0‰ and 
much greater variability among amino acids, diet types and species than essential amino acids 
(Hare et al. 1991, Howland et al. 2003, Jim et al. 2006, mcmahon et al. 2010) (Figure 9a). This 
variability relects the inluence of the varied metabolic processes that shape the isotopic values 
of  non- essential amino acids during metabolic processing. Patterns in  non- essential amino acid 
Δ13c values are less clear than those for essential amino acids but show evidence of both de novo 
biosynthesis from bulk dietary carbon pools as well as direct isotopic routing from dietary protein. 
The relative contributions of isotopic routing versus biosynthesis of  non- essential amino acids has 
been attributed to variability in protein content and amino acid composition of the diet as well as 
differential utilization of dietary constituents contributing to the bulk carbon pool (O’Brien et al. 
2003, Jim et al. 2006, mcmahon et al. 2010, Newsome et al. 2011).
Isotopic routing of individual amino acids from diet to consumer is an important contributor to 
the divergence of consumer bulk stable isotope values from those of its whole diet. If signiicant iso-
topic routing of dietary amino acids into consumer protein occurs, then consumer tissue δ13c values 
will signiicantly underrepresent the  non- protein macronutrient content of the diet. Isotopic routing 
of  non- essential amino acids is predicted to occur when consumers feed on  high- protein diets, as 
this is far more energetically eficient than de novo biosynthesis. Jim et al. (2006) hypothesized that 
a threshold percentage of protein (5% to 12%) exists in the diet, with bone collagen δ13c values rep-
resenting those contributed by dietary protein. Several previous studies have estimated a routing of 
50% to 65% of dietary amino acids to bone collagen when the diet supplied an excess of each amino 
acid (ambrose & Norr 1993, ambrose et al. 1997). much of this work was conducted on terrestrial 
vertebrates, and several studies have found important deviations from these patterns in aquatic ver-
tebrates. In a controlled feeding experiment rearing common mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) 
on four isotopically distinct diets, mcmahon et al. (2010) found a high degree of biosynthesis of

 non- essential amino acids, despite being fed  high- protein diets. The authors suggested that since 
ish use a signiicant portion of dietary protein for energetic purposes (Dosdat et al. 1996), it is 
possible that they exhibit a lower degree of dietary routing than terrestrial vertebrates. Newsome 
et al. (2011) found a similar trend for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in the controlled feeding 
experiment discussed above. The authors showed that even when fed  high- protein diets,  non- protein 
dietary sources (carbohydrates and lipids) contributed a signiicant amount of carbon to the biosyn-
thesis of  non- essential amino acids in the proteinaceous tissues.
variability in  non- essential amino acid Δ13c values also relects differences in utilization of the 
bulk carbon pool from diet (O’Brien et al. 2003, Jim et al. 2006, mcmahon et al. 2010, Newsome 
et al. 2011). For example, catabolizing lipids as a signiicant energy source provides a very 
13 c- depleted carbon pool from which  non- essential amino acids can be biosynthesized. mcmahon 
et al. (2010) showed that the impact of a  lipid- rich diet on the  non- essential amino acid δ13c values 
of ish appears to be greatest near the source of carbon entering glycolysis and becomes diluted 
or altered as carbon lows through the tricarboxylic acid (Tca) cycle. conversely, amino acids 
such as alanine that are synthesized from pyruvate become enriched in ish that are synthesizing 
large quantities of lipids ( gaye- Siessegger et al. 2011). This is because the pyruvate dehydrogenase 
complex heavily fractionates pyruvate when it splits acetyl coenzyme a (coa) and cO2 as a precur-
sor for lipid synthesis, thus leaving the remaining pyruvate enriched. aspartate and glutamate are 
biosynthesized from oxaloacetate and  α- ketoglutarate, respectively, which in turn are generated by 
a variety of precursors in the Krebs cycle. multiple cycling of metabolic intermediates through the 
Krebs cycle likely causes large fractionation during metabolic processing. as a result, Newsome 
et al. (2011) suggested that the δ13c analysis of aspartate and glutamate may be particularly valu-
able for reconstructing bulk diet. SIa of  non- essential amino acids may provide better resolution 
of metabolic processing and carbon utilization than conventional bulk SIa. However, additional 
controlled feeding experiments to examine the underlying mechanisms behind  non- essential amino 
acid fractionation are warranted. These studies are necessary to determine how much information 
on diet and metabolic processing we can glean from  non- essential amino acid stable isotope values.
Nitrogen
as for carbon, amino acids have recently been classiied into two categories, source and trophic 
(Popp et al. 2007), relating to the degree of δ15N fractionation between diet and consumer dur-
ing nitrogen metabolism. It is important to note that while source and essential amino acids all 
show  little- to- no trophic fractionation between diet and consumer, they are not necessarily the same 
suite of amino acids, as is the case for trophic and  non- essential amino acids displaying large tro-
phic discrimination factors (Table 2). The dominant  metabolic- processing routes of source amino 
acids do not signiicantly fractionate nitrogen because those reactions do not form or break bonds 
of nitrogen atoms. For example, there are no  nitrogen- associated reactions in the conversion of 
methionine to  S- adenosylmethionine or phenylalanine to tyrosine. as a result, δ15N values of source 
amino acids in consumers relect δ15Nbase without the confounding variable of trophic discrimina-
tion (mcclelland & montoya 2002, chikaraishi et al. 2007, Popp et al. 2007) (Figures 9B, 9c). 
Sherwood et al. (2011) examined historical nutrient regime shifts in the western North atlantic 
Ocean using source amino acid δ15N variability in  deep- sea gorgonian corals. The authors were able 
to interpret coral amino acid nitrogen isotope values as a proxy for nitrate source and suggested that 
nutrient variability in this region was correlated with recent climate change events.
Trophic amino acids, on the other hand, undergo signiicant fractionation during nitrogen 
metabolism (Figures 9B, 9c). The removal and translocation of the amine functional group during 
deamination and transamination are the dominant metabolic processes in the formation of new 
amino acids via corresponding keto acids. These metabolic processes likely cause nitrogen isotope 
discrimination between the metabolized and remaining amino acids for many trophic amino acids, 
including alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, and glutamic acid (macko et al. 1986). variations

in the magnitude of trophic amino acid fractionation between diet and consumer should relect 
the isotope effect and relative lux of the deamination/ transamination process for each amino acid 
(gaebler et al. 1966). amino acids such as arginine, lysine and histidine that contain multiple nitro-
gen atoms typically have more variable isotopic compositions due to their dependence on multiple 
nitrogen reservoirs and enzymatic inhibition reactions (macko et al. 1987). glutamic acid plays a 
key role in both the synthesis of several other amino acids (lehninger 1975) and the excretion of 
ammonia in many marine taxa (claybrook 1983). Nitrogen is transferred from glutamate via trans-
amination to valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and aspartic acid, leaving gluta-
mate isotopically heavier. Thus, it is not surprising that glutamic acid exhibits a large Δ15N between 
diet and consumer.
 compound- speciic SIa provides an opportunity for more reined estimates of trophic posi-
tion that avoid many of the confounding variables of bulk SIa, particularly variable Δ15N values 
and uncertainty in δ15Nbase.  compound- speciic SIa makes use of the differences in fractionation 
of trophic and source amino acid to provide an internally indexed indicator of trophic position 
that normalizes for differences in δ15Nbase. The general equation for  trophic- level estimation with 
 compound- speciic SIa is as follows:
 
 TPTa- Sa = 1 + (δ15NTa – δ15NSa + β)/Δ15NTa,
where δ15NTa and δ15NSa represent the nitrogen isotope values of the consumer trophic and source 
amino acids, respectively; β represents the difference in δ15N between the trophic and source amino 
acids of primary producers (e.g., –3‰ to –4‰ for aquatic cyanobacteria and algae, +8.4‰ for ter-
restrial c3 plants, and –0.4‰ for terrestrial c4 plants; mcclelland & montoya 2002, chikaraishi 
et al. 2010); and Δ15NTa represents the trophic discrimination factor for the trophic amino acid. 
Phenylalanine consistently shows  little- to- no fractionation across multiple marine and terrestrial 
taxa in feeding experiments and natural samples, making it an ideal source amino acid. glutamic 
acid is typically the chosen trophic amino acid for trophic position calculations, although the mag-
nitude of Δ15N can vary among taxa.
mcclelland & montoya (2002) and chikaraishi et al. (2007) suggested that large 15N enrichment 
in trophic amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid Δ15N = about 7‰) between diet and consumer provides a 
greater capacity for deining trophic level than moderate changes in bulk material (Δ15N = about 
3.4‰). In addition, minimal fractionation of source amino acids (e.g., phenylalanine Δ15N = 0‰) 
provides information on δ15Nbase, as discussed previously. Hence, a single analysis of amino acid 
δ15N values from a consumer tissue provides concurrent information about trophic fractionation 
and δ15Nbase that is not possible using bulk SIa. However, it is important to note that, as was the 
case with bulk trophic position estimates, there are several important assumptions involved with 
the  compound- speciic trophic position equation. In particular, variability in β and Δ15NTa are not 
well constrained as yet. additional controlled experiments to determine the variability in these 
two parameters is necessary to fully realize the potential of the  compound- speciic trophic posi-
tion equation.
One of the biggest challenges of interpreting bulk tissue stable isotope values is the con-
founding effect of changes in trophic position with variations in δ13cbase and δ15Nbase (Post 2002). 
 compound- speciic SIa provides an effective tool to tease apart these confounding variables. For 
instance, Dale et al. (2011) used a  compound- speciic ecogeochemistry approach, coupled with con-
ventional stomach content analysis and bulk SIa, to examine the foraging ecology and habitat use 
of brown stingrays (Dasyatis lata) in Kane’ohe Bay, Hawaii. The authors found a counterintuitive 
trend of decreasing bulk δ15N values as a function of size, with juvenile stingrays having signii-
cantly higher δ15N values than adults. The authors posed two competing hypotheses to explain this 
trend: (1) Stingrays of all sizes were feeding in isotopically similar habitats but decreased in trophic 
position as they moved out of the bay as adults; or (2) the adult stingrays feeding outside the bay 

[Page 28]

354
were feeding in a system with a distinct δ15Nbase value. Using the amino acid trophic position equa-
tion discussed previously, the authors showed that trophic position increased with size despite the 
decrease in bulk δ15N value and conirmed a foraging habitat shift between the bay and deeper water 
coincident with the onset of sexual maturity.
lorrain et al. (2009) used  compound- speciic SIa to examine trophic dynamics of penguins 
in the Indian and Southern Oceans. conventional bulk stable isotope values suggested that king 
(Aptenodytes patagonicus) and adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) penguins occupied the highest trophic 
level, southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) occupied the lowest tro-
phic level, and northern rockhopper penguins (E. chrysocome moseleyi) were intermediate. The 
amino acid δ15N data, however, indicated that king penguins had a higher trophic level compared 
to the other species than was predicted from bulk SIa. Furthermore, northern rockhoppers had a 
higher trophic level than the adélie penguins. However, trophic position alone could not explain the 
patterns in bulk δ15N values of penguins in this study. Signiicant differences were found in δ15N 
values of a source amino acid (phenylalanine) among penguin species, suggesting that northern and 
southern rockhopper penguins were not foraging in the same oceanic regions, and that the differ-
ences in their bulk δ15N values were due, in part, to δ15Nbase differences.
Other elements
The majority of  compound- speciic research in ecogeochemistry has been directed at carbon and 
nitrogen. However, recent work on δ2H of amino acids suggests that  compound- speciic deuterium 
analysis may be a valuable new avenue for studies of movement and foraging. Fogel et al. (2010) 
used bacterial cultures grown on  deuterium- labelled water and growth media to show that δ2H of 
essential amino acids corresponded to the δ2H of diet, but the δ2H of  non- essential amino acids 
relected that of the supplied water (Fogel et al. 2010). The large geographic variation in hydrogen 
isoscapes suggests that δ2H analysis of amino acids may provide a valuable new tracer for studies 
of movement and foraging ecology.
Fatty acids
Fatty acids represent the main constituent of the majority of lipids found in all organisms. Unlike 
proteins that are broken down during digestion, fatty acids of carbon chain length 14 or more are 
not degraded once they are released from dietary lipid molecules during digestion. Once fatty acids 
have been incorporated into consumer tissue, they are either used for energy or reesteriied and 
stored in adipose tissue, often as triacylglycerols. Thus, fatty acids are generally deposited into 
adipose tissue in predictable patterns with little modiication, providing an integrated record of 
diet (Iverson et al. 2004). marine organisms have a diverse suite of  long- chain, polyunsaturated 
fatty acids that originate from various microorganisms, phytoplankton, and higher plants (ackman 
1980). a number of studies have shown that speciic fatty acid patterns are passed from diet to con-
sumer for a variety of taxa, from zooplankton and benthic macrofauna to pinnipeds and cetaceans 
(see Iverson et al. 2004, Budge et al. 2006 and references therein). given that the pattern of fatty 
acids found in some plants and in many ish and invertebrates can be used to identify individual spe-
cies accurately (Iverson et al. 1997, Budge et al. 2002), fatty acid proiles have become a powerful 
tool for quantitative assessment of predator diets (Iverson et al. 2004).
much of the previous research using fatty acid signatures to examine spatial or temporal varia-
tions in diet and trophic ecology has been qualitative examination of changes in consumer fatty acid 
signatures alone (e.g., Iverson et al. 1997, mcmahon et al. 2006). However, Iverson et al. (2004) 
developed a quantitative statistical model to estimate the contributions of prey species to the diets 
of predators using fatty acid signatures. This method computes the most likely combination of diet 
fatty acid signatures that matches the consumer, after accounting for consumer fatty acid metabo-
lism (Budge et al. 2012). To be successful, this method requires that the fatty acid compositions of 

[Page 29]

355
all important diet sources must be known, and there must be suficient  within- species sampling 
to assess variability in fatty acid signatures with ecological and demographic factors (e.g., Budge 
et al. 2002).
 compound- speciic SIa of fatty acids has the advantage of providing both fatty acid proiles 
and isotopic information for dietary studies (e.g., Uhle et al. 1997, mcleod & wing 2007, Budge 
et al. 2008). Stable carbon isotope analysis of fatty acids shows similar patterns to those discussed 
for amino acids, with some fatty acids showing signiicant  diet- to- consumer discrimination and 
others showing  little- to- no isotopic change. while the δ13c value of pooled fatty acids is similar 
to that of the bulk carbon pool, individual storage fatty acids in consumers differ from dietary 
fatty acid due to chain elongation and dehydrogenation as well as metabolic turnover processes 
(Stott et al. 1997, Hammer et al. 1998). The kinetic isotope effect resulting from metabolic process-
ing of  non- essential fatty acids may hold valuable information about carbon utilization, similar to 
 non- essential amino acids (Uhle et al. 1997). conversely, essential fatty acids, such as omega fatty 
acids (e.g., linoleic acid 18:2n-6), are directly incorporated from diet into consumer tissue (Stott 
et al. 1997). Isotopic routing of essential fatty acids provides a record of the isotopic signature of the 
dietary source preserved in consumer tissues, much like essential amino acids.
Budge et al. (2008) found that ice algae and phytoplankton, the two dominant forms of primary 
production fuelling arctic food webs, had distinct differences in fatty acid proiles and unique δ13c 
signatures of two individual fatty acids, 16:4n-1 (-24.0‰ ± 2.4‰ and –30.7‰ ± 0.8‰, respectively) 
and 20:5n-3 (-18.3‰ ± 2.0‰ and –26.9‰ ± 0.7‰, respectively). The authors used these differences 
in base of the food web end members to track carbon low pathways to consumers at the upper 
trophic level, including ish, seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans. They found that although ice algae 
were only available to consumers for a short period of time (april– may), ice  algae- derived carbon 
contributed up to 24% of the carbon passed on to upper trophic levels.
cholesterol has also been shown to be an indicator of  short- term,  whole- diet δ13c values in 
several controlled feeding experiments on terrestrial vertebrates (Stott et al. 1997, Howland et al. 
2003, Jim et al. 2004). Howland et al. (2003) found that pig bone cholesterol δ13c values were 3.4‰ 
depleted relative to whole diet, owing to a kinetic isotope effect resulting from oxidation of pyru-
vate to  acetyl- coa by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. This offset indicates that even though 
cholesterol was present in the diet, the bone cholesterol was biosynthesized from a bulk carbon pool 
rather than isotopically routed directly from the diet.
Conclusions and future directions
Ecogeochemistry relies, in large part, on isoscapes that integrate chemical, physical and biologi-
cal processes that ultimately determine the isotope composition of marine animals. To enhance 
the use of isoscapes, we need continued efforts to collect and analyse isotope data throughout the 
world’s oceans. marine systems are inherently dynamic, and the generation of temporally explicit 
isoscapes will greatly enhance the accuracy and scope of ecogeochemistry studies. This is par-
ticularly important in light of the growing effects of climate change and ocean acidiication on the 
biological, chemical and physical processes in our oceans (Bowen 2010). For example, the effects 
of temperature on productivity and the frequency and distribution of hypoxic events will potentially 
shift baseline isoscapes and change patterns of variability across spatial and temporal scales. In 
addition, we need increased modelling efforts that address the complex ecosystem processes driv-
ing geographic variability in isotope distributions. This requires new  process- based research to help 
explain the underlying mechanisms driving spatiotemporal variability in isotopes (Schmittner et al. 
2008, Somes et al. 2010).
Enhanced knowledge of isotopic routing, tissue turnover rates and fractionation factors is nec-
essary to fully realize the potential of ecogeochemistry. we are conident that  compound- speciic 
SIa will improve the resolution of studies investigating trophic dynamics and movements. However,

we clearly need additional controlled feeding experiments to understand the mechanisms that con-
trol  non- essential and trophic amino acid stable isotope values. Improving instrument sensitivity 
is likely to reduce sample size requirements and increase temporal resolution from analyses of 
accretionary tissues. gains in instrument sensitivity will be particularly helpful when applied to the 
analysis of individual compounds. Finally, we need improved networking to enhance the dissemina-
tion and exchange of data among ecogeochemists. This will require increased collaboration among 
geochemists, ecologists, geostatisticians and software developers, as well as the establishment of 
easily accessible public databases.
