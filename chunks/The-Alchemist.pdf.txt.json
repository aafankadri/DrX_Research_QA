A bookseller in the northeast corner of\nthe country told me that only one person purchased a copy the first\nweek of its release. It took another six months for the bookseller to\nunload a second copy—and that was to the same person who\nbought the first! And who knows how long it took to sell the third.\nBy the end of the year, it was clear to everyone that The Alchemist\nwasn’t working. My original publisher decided to cut me loose and\ncancelled our contract. They wiped their hands of the project and let\nme take the book with me. I was forty-one and desperate.\nBut I never lost faith in the book or ever wavered in my vision.\nWhy? Because it was me in there, all of me, heart and soul. I was\nliving my own metaphor. A man sets out on a journey, dreaming of a\nbeautiful or magical place, in pursuit of some unknown treasure. At\nthe end of his journey, the man realizes the treasure was with him\nthe entire time. I was following my Personal Legend, and my\ntreasure was my capacity to write. And I wanted to share this\ntreasure with the world.\nAs I wrote in The Alchemist, when you want something, the whole\nuniverse conspires to help you. I started knocking on the doors of\nother publishers. One opened, and the publisher on the other side\nbelieved in me and my book and agreed to give The Alchemist a\nsecond chance. Slowly, through word of mouth, it finally started to\nsell—three thousand, then six thousand, ten thousand—book by\nbook, gradually throughout the year.\nEight months later, an American visiting Brazil picked up a copy of\nThe Alchemist in a local bookstore. He wanted to translate the book\nand help me find a publisher in the United States. HarperCollins\nagreed to bring it to an American audience, publishing it with great\nfanfare: ads in the New York Times and influential news magazines,\n\n"

Leafing through the pages, he found a story about\nNarcissus.\nThe alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt\ndaily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so\nfascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and\ndrowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was\ncalled the narcissus.\nBut this was not how the author of the book ended the story.\nHe said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest\nappeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water,\ntransformed into a lake of salty tears.\n“Why do you weep?” the goddesses asked.\n“I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied.\n“Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for\nthough we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could\ncontemplate his beauty close at hand.”\n“But . . . was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked.\n“Who better than you to know that?” the goddesses said in\nwonder. “After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to\ncontemplate himself!”\nThe lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:\n“I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was\nbeautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I\ncould see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.”\n“What a lovely story,” the alchemist thought.\n\n"

He had been to the village only\nonce, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry\ngoods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in\nhis presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the\nboy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.\n“I need to sell some wool,” the boy told the merchant.\nThe shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until\nthe afternoon.

I don’t know\nhow animals know the age of human beings.”\n“Tell me more about your dream,” said the woman. “I have to get\nback to my cooking, and, since you don’t have much money, I can’t\ngive you a lot of time.”\n“The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,”\ncontinued the boy, a bit upset. “And suddenly, the child took me by\nboth hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”\nHe paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the\nEgyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.\n“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words\nslowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to\nme, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as\nshe was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both\ntimes.”\nThe woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his\nhands and studied them carefully.\n\n"

He was going to be able to\nsave the little money he had because of a dream about hidden\ntreasure!\n“Well, interpret the dream,” he said.\n“First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of your\ntreasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”\nThe shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to\nswear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n“It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can\ninterpret it, but the interpretation is very difficult. That’s why I feel that\nI deserve a part of what you find.\n“And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in\nEgypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed\nthem to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make\nyou a rich man.”\nThe boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need to seek\nout the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t\ngoing to have to pay anything.\n“I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.\n“I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple\nthings in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able\nto understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn\nother arts, such as the reading of palms.”\n“Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?”\n“I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into reality.\nThat’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with.”\n“And what if I never get to Egypt?”\n“Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”\nAnd the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already\nwasted too much time with him.\nSo the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never\nagain believe in dreams.

When someone sees the\nsame people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary,\nthey wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they\nwant the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them\nto be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear\nidea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his\nor her own.\nHe decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky\nbefore following his flock back through the fields. Three days from\nnow, he would be with the merchant’s daughter.\nHe started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page\nit described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people\ninvolved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he\nthought, he would present one person at a time, so that the reader\nwouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.\nWhen he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading,\nhe liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he\nwelcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat\ndown at his side and tried to strike up a conversation.\n“What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people\nin the plaza.\n“Working,” the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted\nto concentrate on his reading.\nActually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the\nmerchant’s daughter, so that she could see that he was someone\nwho was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined\nthe scene many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when\nhe explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front.

The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to\nanother bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the\nelderly. So he held out the book to the man—for two reasons: first,\nthat he, himself, wasn’t sure how to pronounce the title; and second,\nthat if the old man didn’t know how to read, he would probably feel\nashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches.\n“Hmm . . .” said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if\nit were some strange object. “This is an important book, but it’s really\nirritating.”\nThe boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had\nalready read the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man\nhad said, the boy still had time to change it for another.\n“It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in\nthe world say,” continued the old man. “It describes people’s inability\nto choose their own Personal Legends. And it ends up saying that\neveryone believes the world’s greatest lie.”\n“What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely\nsurprised.\n“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of\nwhat’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.\nThat’s the world’s greatest lie.”\n“That’s never happened to me,” the boy said. “They wanted me to\nbe a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd.”\n“Much better,” said the old man. “Because you really like to travel.”\n\n"

Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one had only to cross\nthe narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, shopping\nand chanting their strange prayers several times a day.\n“Where are you from?” the boy asked.\n“From many places.”\n“No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd,\nand I have been to many places, but I come from only one place—\nfrom a city near an ancient castle. That’s where I was born.”\n“Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”\nThe boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask,\nfearing that he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in the\nplaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them\nseemed to be very busy.\n“So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.\n“It’s like it always has been.”\nNo clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it\nwere, he would already have heard of it.\n“And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.\n“What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the king\nof Salem!”\nPeople say strange things, the boy thought.

But when you’re talking to people, they\nsay some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to\ncontinue the conversation.\n“My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep\ndo you have?”\n“Enough,” said the boy.

When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read\nwhat the old man had written in the sand.\nThere, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the\nnames of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he\nhad attended.

But he wanted to know what the “mysterious force” was; the\nmerchant’s daughter would be impressed when he told her about\nthat!\n“It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you\nhow to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and your\nwill, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are,\nor whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s\nbecause that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your\nmission on earth.”\n“Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of\na textile merchant?”\n“Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is\nnourished by people’s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy,\nand jealousy. To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’s only\nreal obligation. All things are one.\n“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in\nhelping you to achieve it.”\nThey were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the\ntownspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.\n“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”\n“Because I like to travel.”\nThe old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at\none corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to\ntravel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some\nmoney aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in\nAfrica. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in their\nlives, of doing what they dream of.”\n“He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.\n“Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are\nmore important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while\nshepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their\nchildren marry bakers than shepherds.”\nThe boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’s\ndaughter. There was surely a baker in her town.\n\n"

And you\nare at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”\n“And that’s when you always appear on the scene?”\n“Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or\nanother. Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good\nidea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things\nto happen. There are other things I do, too, but most of the time\npeople don’t realize I’ve done them.”\nThe old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to\nappear before a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner\nhad abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years\nhe had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of\nthousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to\ngive it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one\nmore stone—just one more—he would find his emerald. Since the\nminer had sacrificed everything to his Personal Legend, the old man\ndecided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone\nthat rolled up to the miner’s foot. The miner, with all the anger and\nfrustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw it\naside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it\nfell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most\nbeautiful emerald in the world.\n“People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,”\nsaid the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they\ngive up on it so early, too.

This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.”\nThe old man returned the book to the boy.\n“Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock.

He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of\nbread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what\nthe old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave\nthings as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing.\nIf he were to say anything, the baker would spend three days\nthinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to the\nway things were.

He suggested that the boy look\naround the palace and return in two hours.\n“‘Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,’ said the wise\nman, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. ‘As you\nwander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to\nspill.’\n“The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of\nthe palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he\nreturned to the room where the wise man was.\n“‘Well,’ asked the wise man, ‘did you see the Persian tapestries\nthat are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it\ntook the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the\nbeautiful parchments in my library?’\n“The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed\nnothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise\nman had entrusted to him.\n“‘Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,’ said the\nwise man. ‘You cannot trust a man if you don’t know"

He had understood the story the old\nking had told him. A shepherd may like to travel, but he should never\nforget about his sheep.\nThe old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together,\nmade several strange gestures over the boy’s head. Then, taking his\nsheep, he walked away.\nAt the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort, built by the Moors.\nFrom atop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek,\nthe king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt\nthe levanter blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy\nwith their new owner and excited by so much change. All they\nwanted was food and water.\nMelchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of\nthe port.

Then when he spoke about me he\nwould say that I am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.\nHe looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, “I know it’s\nthe vanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king\nsometimes has to take some pride in himself.”\nHow strange Africa is, thought the boy.\nHe was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen\nalong the narrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from a\ngigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other. In just a few\nhours he had seen men walking hand in hand, women with their\nfaces covered, and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and\nchanted—as everyone about him went to their knees and placed\ntheir foreheads on the ground.\n“A practice of infidels,” he said to himself. As a child in church, he\nhad always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his\nwhite horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these\nkneeling at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels\nhad an evil look about them.\nBesides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail,\njust one detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long\ntime: only Arabic was spoken in this country.\nThe owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a\ndrink that had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a\nbitter tea. The boy preferred wine.\nBut he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had to\nbe concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go\nabout getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough\nmoney in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was\nmagic; whoever has money is never really alone.

He\nhad discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a\nsnake was nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there\nwas water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.\nIf God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he\nthought, and that made him feel better.

We’re only two hours\nfrom Spain.”\n“Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And\nask for a glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.”\n“There is no wine in this country,” the young man said. “The\nreligion here forbids it.”\nThe boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He\nalmost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If\nhe did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as\npayment for taking him there. He remembered what the old man had\nsaid about offering something you didn’t even have yet.\n“I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as\nmy guide.”\n“Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.\nThe boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening\nattentively to their conversation.

At\nthe same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading\nfor Mecca.

The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who\nspent most of his time with his books.\nThe boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and\npeople across the desert. Now everything was quite different from\nhow it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion\nand shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all\nmixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.\nBut, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind,\nand of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little\nto one another.\n“I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel\ndrivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so\ndistant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should\nremain silent.”\nThe boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever\nhaving set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a\nfire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.\nI’ve learned things from the sheep, and I’ve learned things from\ncrystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It\nseems old and wise.\nThe wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had\nsat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It\nreminded him of the wool from his sheep . . . his sheep who were\nnow seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they\nalways had.\n“They’re not my sheep anymore,” he said to himself, without\nnostalgia. “They must be used to their new shepherd, and have\nprobably already forgotten me. That’s good. Creatures like the\nsheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”\nHe thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she had\nprobably married.

If the\nsand was too fine for the animals’ hooves, they sought a way where\nthe sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was\ncovered with the salt of dried-up lakes.

One year,\nwhen the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I\nsatisfied the only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, and\nthat made me feel good.\n“One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its\nbanks. It was something that I thought could happen only to others,\nnever to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees\nin the flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I\nthought that everything I owned would be destroyed.\n“The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a\nliving. So now I’m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to\nunderstand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if\nthey are capable of achieving what they need and want.\n“We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or our\npossessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we\nunderstand that our life stories and the history of the world were\nwritten by the same hand.”\nSometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had\nsomething that the other needed—as if everything were indeed\nwritten by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers\nexchanged information about windstorms, and told stories about the\ndesert.\nAt other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were\nBedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route. They\nprovided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in\nsilence and departed the same way, dressed in black garments that\nshowed only their eyes.

The rest is up to Allah,\nincluding the danger.”\nAnd he concluded by saying the mysterious word: “Maktub.”\n“You should pay more attention to the caravan,” the boy said to\nthe Englishman, after the camel driver had left. “We make a lot of\ndetours, but we’re always heading for the same destination.”\n“And you ought to read more about the world,” answered the\nEnglishman. “Books are like caravans in that respect.”\nThe immense collection of people and animals began to travel\nfaster.

We are part of that soul, so\nwe rarely recognize that it is working for us.

They spoke about mercury, salt, dragons,\nand kings, and he didn’t understand any of it.

They were men who had dedicated their entire\nlives to the purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed\nthat, if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all\nits individual properties, and what was left would be the Soul of the\nWorld. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything\non the face of the earth, because it was the language with which all\nthings communicated. They called that discovery the Master Work—\nit was part liquid and part solid.\n“Can’t you just observe men and omens in order to understand\nthe language?” the boy asked.\n“You have a mania for simplifying everything,” answered the\nEnglishman, irritated. “Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step\nhas to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.”\nThe boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called\nthe Elixir of Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the\nalchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the\nPhilosopher’s Stone.\n“It’s not easy to find the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the\nEnglishman. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories,\nobserving the fire that purified the metals. They spent so much time\nclose to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world.\nThey discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a\npurification of themselves.”\nThe boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it\nwas a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he\ncould free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming\nmore and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s\ndaily life.\n“Also,” said the Englishman, “the Philosopher’s Stone has a\nfascinating property. A small sliver of the stone can transform large\nquantities of metal into gold.”\nHaving heard that, the boy became even more interested in\nalchemy. He thought that, with some patience, he’d be able to\ntransform everything into gold. He read the lives of the various\npeople who had succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli,\nand Geber.

But, finally, he\nagreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so.\nThe boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a\ngoatskin with water.\n“Good afternoon, ma’am. I’m trying to find out where the alchemist\nlives here at the oasis.”\nThe woman said she had never heard of such a person, and\nhurried away. But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had\nbetter not try to converse with women who were dressed in black,\nbecause they were married women. He should respect tradition.\nThe Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the\nlong journey for nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was\nin pursuit of his Personal Legend. And, when someone was in such\npursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed—\nthat’s what the old king had said. He couldn’t have been wrong.\n“I had never heard of alchemists before,” the boy said. “Maybe no\none here has, either.”\nThe Englishman’s eyes lit up. “That’s it! Maybe no one here knows\nwhat an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people’s\nillnesses!”\nSeveral women dressed in black came to the well for water, but\nthe boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’s\ninsistence. Then a man approached.\n“Do you know someone here who cures people’s illnesses?” the\nboy asked.\n“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the\nstrangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses\nfrom the Koran, and moved on.\n\n"

It required no explanation,\njust as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.\nWhat the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of\nthe only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she\nrecognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of\nanything in the world. He had been told by his parents and\ngrandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person\nbefore becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way\nhad never learned the universal language. Because, when you know\nthat language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world\nawaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great\ncity. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes\nmeet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that\nmoment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun\nhas been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love,\nand creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such\nlove, one’s dreams would have no meaning.\nMaktub, thought the boy.\nThe Englishman shook the boy: “Come on, ask her!”\nThe boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did\nthe same.\n“What’s your name?” he asked.\n“Fatima,” the girl said, averting her eyes.\n“That’s what some women in my country are called.”\n“It’s the name of the Prophet’s daughter,” Fatima said. “The\ninvaders carried the name everywhere.” The beautiful girl spoke of\nthe invaders with pride.\nThe Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the\nman who cured people’s illnesses.\n“That’s the man who knows all the secrets of the world,” she said.\n“He communicates with the genies of the desert.”\nThe genies were the spirits of good and evil.

He knew that his love for her would enable him to\ndiscover every treasure in the world.\nThe next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl.\nTo his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.\n“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with\nthe first stars of evening.

He told\nher about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the\ncrystal shop. They became friends, and except for the fifteen\nminutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never\npass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, the leader\nof the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with\nhim.\n“We don’t know when the war will end, so we can’t continue our\njourney,” he said. “The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even\nyears. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is\nimportant to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a\nwar between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and,\nwhen that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others—because\nAllah is on both sides.”\nThe people went back to where they were living, and the boy went\nto meet with Fatima that afternoon.

He thought of all the\nmarried shepherds he had known. They had a difficult time\nconvincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love\nrequired them to stay with the people they loved.\nHe told Fatima that, at their next meeting.\n“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return,”\nshe said. “We know that, and we are used to it.

He felt the urge to go out into\nthe desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.\nHe wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis\nwithin sight. He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his\nfeet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in\nremote times, had been a sea.

The area was\nswirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before him\nwas an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening\nscream.\nWhen the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what\nhe saw. Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in\nblack, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban\nand his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black\nkerchief. He appeared to be a messenger from the desert, but his\npresence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.\nThe strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a\nscabbard mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in\nthe light of the moon.\n“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?” he\ndemanded, so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty\nthousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum.\n“It is I who dared to do so,” said the boy.

Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly, until\nthe point touched the boy’s forehead. It drew a droplet of blood.\nThe horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy. It didn’t\neven occur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strange sense of\njoy: he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And for\nFatima. The omens had been true, after all. Here he was, face-to-\nface with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned about\ndying—the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon be a\npart of it. And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be a part of that\nSoul.\nThe stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy’s forehead.\n“Why did you read the flight of the birds?”\n“I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted to save\nthe oasis. Tomorrow all of you will die, because there are more men\nat the oasis than you have.”\nThe sword remained where it was. “Who are you to change what\nAllah has willed?”\n“Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah\ntaught me the language of the birds. Everything has been written by\nthe same hand,” the boy said, remembering the camel driver’s\nwords.\nThe stranger withdrew the sword from the boy’s forehead, and the\nboy felt immensely relieved. But he still couldn’t flee.\n“Be careful with your prognostications,” said the stranger. “When\nsomething is written, there is no way to change it.”\n“All I saw was an army,” said the boy. “I didn’t see the outcome of\nthe battle.”\nThe stranger seemed satisfied with the answer. But he kept the\nsword in his hand. “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?”\n“I am following my Personal Legend. It’s not something you would\nunderstand.”\n\n"

The\nmounted troops entered the oasis from the north; it appeared to be a\npeaceful expedition, but they all carried arms hidden in their robes.\nWhen they reached the white tent at the center of Al-Fayoum, they\nwithdrew their scimitars and rifles. And they attacked an empty tent.\nThe men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert\nand within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The\nchildren had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees,\nand saw nothing of what had happened.

The commander said\nthat his men had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many\ndays of battle, and had decided to take the oasis so as to be able to\nreturn to the war.\nThe tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but\nthat the Tradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to\ndeath without honor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet,\nhe was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the\ndesert wind.\nThe tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty\npieces of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and\nasked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.\nWhen the sun had set, and the first stars made their appearance, the\nboy started to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent,\nand a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place\ninhabited by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.\nNot until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He\ncarried two dead hawks over his shoulder.\n“I am here,” the boy said.\n“You shouldn’t be here,” the alchemist answered. “Or is it your\nPersonal Legend that brings you here?”\n“With the wars between the tribes, it’s impossible to cross the\ndesert. So I have come here.”\nThe alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the\nboy should enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the\noasis. The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus\nused in alchemy, but saw none. There were only some books in a\npile, a small cooking stove, and the carpets, covered with mysterious\ndesigns.\n“Sit down.

It was better than the\nscent of the hookahs.\n“Why did you want to see me?” the boy asked.\n“Because of the omens,” the alchemist answered. “The wind told\nme you would be coming, and that you would need help.”\n“It’s not I the wind spoke about. It’s the other foreigner, the\nEnglishman. He’s the one that’s looking for you.”\n“He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He has\nbegun to try to understand the desert.”\n“And what about me?”\n“When a person really desires something, all the universe\nconspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the\nalchemist, echoing the words of the old king. The boy understood.\nAnother person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.\n“So you are going to instruct me?”\n“No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to\npoint you in the direction of your treasure.”\n“But there’s a tribal war,” the boy reiterated.\n“I know what’s happening in the desert.”\n“I have already found my treasure. I have a camel, I have my\nmoney from the crystal shop, and I have fifty gold pieces. In my own\ncountry, I would be a rich man.”\n“But none of that is from the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.\n“I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I\nhave won.”\n“She wasn’t found at the Pyramids, either.”\nThey ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a\nred liquid into the boy’s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had\never tasted.\n“Isn’t wine prohibited here?” the boy asked\n“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil,” said the alchemist.\n“It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”\nThe alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine,\nhe relaxed.

Something was moving there, and the\nalchemist’s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes—squinted with\nhis effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the\nhole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm\nand leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.\nThe boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake\nfought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of\nthe desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in\nminutes.\n“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the\nalchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been\nbitten, his expression was calm. “The alchemist is two hundred years\nold,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with\nthe snakes of the desert.\nThe boy watched as his companion went to his horse and\nwithdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and\nthen he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.\n“Not to worry,” said the alchemist. “He won’t leave the circle. You\nfound life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”\n“Why was that so important?”\n“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.” The boy\ndidn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy, and he\nhad been melancholy since the previous night. To continue his\nsearch for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.\n“I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist said.\n“I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found Fatima,\nand, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than treasure.”\n\n"

The\nalchemist had become much more cautious, because they were\napproaching the area where the most violent battles were being\nwaged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.\nIt was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been\nready to tell its story, but lately that wasn’t true. There had been\ntimes when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other\ntimes it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy\nhad to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy\nof treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the\nendless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even\nwhen the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.\n“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when\nthey had made camp that day.\n“Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your\ntreasure.”\n“But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets\nemotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It\nasks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when\nI’m thinking about her.”\n“Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has\nto say.”\nDuring the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number\nof armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The boy’s heart\nbegan to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul\n\n"

Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that\nhe might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the\ndesert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found\nlove and riches.\n“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they\nhad paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”\n“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid\nthat, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.”\n“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”\n“Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you\npretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there\ninside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about\nthe world.”\n“You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?”\n“Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your\nheart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know\nits dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.\n“You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to\nlisten to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an\nunanticipated blow.”\nThe boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the\ndesert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it\nas it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to\nthe oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was\nhappy. “Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “it’s because I’m\nthe heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are\nafraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that\nthey don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve them.\nWe, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go\naway forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren’t,\nor of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden\nin the sands.

When I have been truly\nsearching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that I\nnever would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that\nseemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”\nSo his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy\nslept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him things\nthat came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are\nhappy have God within them. And that happiness could be found in a\ngrain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said. Because a\ngrain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken\nmillions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a treasure that\nawaits him,” his heart said. “We, people’s hearts, seldom say much\nabout those treasures, because people no longer want to go in\nsearch of them. We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply\nlet life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But,\nunfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to\ntheir Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the\nworld as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns\nout, indeed, to be a threatening place.\n“So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop\nspeaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard:\nwe don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their\nhearts.”\n“Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their\ndreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.\n“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t\nlike to suffer.”\nFrom then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please,\nnever to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far\nfrom his dreams, his heart"

And the alchemist\nunderstood that the boy’s heart had returned to the Soul of the\nWorld.\n“So what should I do now?” the boy asked.\n“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.\n“And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable of\nshowing you where the treasure is.”\n“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”\n“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is this:\nbefore a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything\nthat was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but\nso that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the\nlessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s\nthe point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we\nsay in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the\npalm trees have appeared on the horizon.’\n“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends\nwith the victor’s being severely tested.”\nThe boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that\nthe darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.\nOn the following day, the first clear sign of danger appeared. Three\narmed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and the\nalchemist were doing there.\n“I’m hunting with my falcon,” the alchemist answered.\n“We’re going to have to search you to see whether you’re armed,”\none of the tribesmen said.\nThe alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same.\n“Why are you carrying money?” asked the tribesman, when he\nhad searched the boy’s bag.\n“I need it to get to the Pyramids,” he said.\nThe tribesman who was searching the alchemist’s belongings\nfound a small crystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg\nthat was slightly larger than a chicken’s egg.\n“What are these things?” he asked.\n\n"

With every day that passed, the\nboy’s heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to\nknow about things of the past or future; it was content simply to\ncontemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of\nthe World. The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither\nwas capable now of betraying the other.\nWhen his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the\nboy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in\nthe desert were wearisome.

There had been two thieves farther\nahead who were planning to steal the boy’s sheep and murder him.\nBut, since the boy hadn’t passed by, they had decided to move on,\nthinking that he had changed his route.\n“Does a man’s heart always help him?” the boy asked the\nalchemist.\n“Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their\nPersonal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the\nelderly, too.”\n“Does that mean that I’ll never run into danger?”\n“It means only that the heart does what it can,” the alchemist said.\nOne afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the\ntribes. At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful\nwhite robes, with arms at the ready. The men were smoking their\nhookahs and trading stories from the battlefield. No one paid any\nattention to the two travelers.\n“There’s no danger,” the boy said, when they had moved on past\nthe encampment.\nThe alchemist sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never\nforget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one\nanother, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No\none fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.”\nAll things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert\nwanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horsemen\nappeared from behind the travelers.\n“You can’t go any farther,” one of them said. “You’re in the area\nwhere the tribes are at war.”\n“I’m not going very far,” the alchemist answered, looking straight\ninto the eyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a moment, and\nthen agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along.\nThe boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated\nthose horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said.\n“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the\nalchemist.\nThat’s true, the boy thought.

It is about penetrating to the\nSoul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been\nreserved for you.”\n“No, that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about transforming lead\ninto gold.”\nThe alchemist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy\nonly after they had stopped to eat.\n“Everything in the universe evolved,” he said. “And, for wise men,\ngold is the metal that evolved the furthest.

Then it became a signal of danger. And, finally,\nit became just a whinny again.”\nBut then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all\nthat.\n“I have known true alchemists,” the alchemist continued. “They\nlocked themselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold\nhad.

I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the\nstars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made by\nthe same hand, and we have the same soul.

But people can’t turn themselves into the wind.”\n“Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said.\n“So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and\nthe winds.”\nThe wind’s curiosity was aroused, something that had never\nhappened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn’t\nknow how to turn a man into the wind. And look how many things the\nwind already knew how to do! It created deserts, sank ships, felled\nentire forests, and blew through cities filled with music and strange\nnoises. It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying that\nthere were other things the wind should be able to do.\n“This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind was\nclose to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you can\ndo anything in creation. When you are loved, there’s no need at all to\nunderstand what’s happening, because everything happens within\nyou, and even men can turn themselves into the wind. As long as the\nwind helps, of course.”\nThe wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with\nwhat the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the\ndesert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its\nway around the world, it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind.\nAnd it knew nothing about love.\n“In my travels around the world,"

Then I can look to\nheaven without blinding myself.”\nSo the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with\nsand. The sun was turned into a golden disk.\nAt the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert\nwere already familiar with that wind. They called it the simum, and it\nwas worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their\nweapons were filled with sand.\nOn the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and\nsaid, “Maybe we had better end this!”\nThey could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the\nblue cloths, and their eyes showed fear.\n“Let’s stop this,” another commander said.\n“I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect.\n“I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”\nBut he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had\nexpressed their fear. As soon as the wind stopped, he was going to\nremove them from their commands, because true men of the desert\nare not afraid.\n“The wind told me that you know about love,” the boy said to the\nsun. “If you know about love, you must also know about the Soul of\nthe World, because it’s made of love.”\n“From where I am,” the sun said, “I can see the Soul of the World.\nIt communicates with my soul, and together we cause the plants to\ngrow and the sheep to seek out shade. From where I am—and I’m a\nlong way from the earth—I learned how to love.

Each performs its own exact function as a unique\nbeing, and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand that\nwrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.\n“But there was a sixth day,” the sun went on.\n“You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,”\nthe boy said. “But you don’t know about love. If there hadn’t been a\nsixth day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper,\nand lead just lead. It’s true that everything has its Personal Legend,\nbut one day that Personal Legend will be realized.

They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”\nThe boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his\nshovel hit something solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest\nof Spanish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gold masks\nadorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded\nwith jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago\n\n"

He had used\nthe two stones only once, one morning when he was at a\nmarketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with\nenough omens.\nHe placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part\nof his new treasure, because they were a reminder of the old king,\nwhom he would never see again.\nIt’s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal\nLegend, the boy thought. Then he remembered that he had to get to\nTarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy\nwoman, as he had promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, he\nthought. Maybe it was because they moved around so much.\nThe wind began to blow again. It was the levanter, the wind that\ncame from Africa. It didn’t bring with it the smell of the desert, nor the\nthreat of Moorish invasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a perfume\nhe knew well, and the touch of a kiss—a kiss that came from far\naway, slowly, slowly, until it rested on his lips.\nThe boy smiled. It was the first time she had done that.\n“I’m coming, Fatima,” he said.\n\n"

He had never seen her before.\n“Have you ever visited that temple?” she asked. “Go there and tell\nme what you think of it?”\nSeduced by the woman’s beauty, the boy went to the place she\nhad indicated. He sat down on the beach and stared out at the\nhorizon, but he saw only what he always saw: blue sky and ocean.\nDisappointed, he walked to a nearby fishing village and asked if\nanyone there knew about an island and a temple.\n“Oh, that was many years ago, when my great-grandparents were\nalive,” said an old fisherman. “There was an earthquake, and the\nisland was swallowed up by the sea. But although we can no longer\nsee the island, we can still hear the temple bells when the ocean\nsets them swinging down below.”\nThe boy went back to the beach and tried to hear the bells. He\nspent the whole afternoon there, but all he heard was the noise of\nthe waves and the cries of the seagulls.\nWhen night fell, his parents came looking for him. The following\nmorning, he went back to the beach; he could not believe that such a\nbeautiful woman would have lied to him. If she ever returned, he\ncould tell her that, although he had not seen the island, he had heard\nthe temple bells set ringing by the motion of the waves.\nMany months passed; the woman did not return and the boy\nforgot all about her; now he was convinced that he needed to\ndiscover the riches and treasures in the submerged temple.

He became the\nbutt of all the other children’s jokes. They used to say: “He’s not like\nus. He prefers to sit looking at the sea because he’s afraid of being\nbeaten in our games.”\nAnd they all laughed to see the boy sitting on the shore.\nAlthough he still could not hear the old temple bells ringing, the\nboy learned about other things. He began to realize that he had\ngrown so used to the sound of the waves that he was no longer\ndistracted by them. Soon after that, he became used to the cries of\nthe seagulls, the buzzing of the bees and the wind blowing amongst\nthe palm trees.\nSix months after his first conversation with the woman, the boy\ncould sit there oblivious to all other noises, but he still could not hear\nthe bells from the drowned temple.\nFishermen came and talked to him, insisting that they had heard\nthe bells.\nBut the boy never did.\nSome time later, however, the fishermen changed their tune: “You\nspend far too much time thinking about the bells beneath the sea.\nForget about them and go back to playing with your friends. Perhaps\nit’s only fishermen who can hear them.”\nAfter almost a year, the boy thought: “Perhaps they’re right. I\nwould do better to grow up and become a fisherman and come down\nto this beach every morning, because I’ve come to love it here.” And\nhe thought too: “Perhaps it’s just another legend and the bells were\nall shattered during the earthquake and have never rung out since.”\nThat afternoon, he decided to go back home.\nHe walked down to the ocean to say goodbye. He looked once\nmore at the natural world around him and because he was no longer\nconcerned about the bells, he could again smile at the beauty of the\nseagulls’ cries, the roar of the sea, and the wind blowing in the palm\ntrees. Far off, he heard the sound of his friends playing and he felt\nglad to think that he would soon resume his childhood games.\nThe boy was happy and—as only a child can—he felt grateful for\nbeing alive.

He no longer dreamed of finding\ntreasure at the bottom of the sea; perhaps that had all been a\nproduct of his imagination, and he had never really heard the\nsubmerged bells ring out on one lost childhood afternoon. Even so,\nhe decided to walk for a while along the beach, to listen to the noise\nof the wind and to the cries of the seagulls.\nImagine his surprise when, there on the beach, he saw the\nwoman who had first spoken to him about the island and its temple.\n“What are you doing here?” he asked.\n“I was waiting for you,” she replied.\nHe noticed that, despite the passing years, the woman looked\nexactly the same; the veil hiding her hair had not faded with time.\nShe handed him a blue notebook full of blank pages.\n“Write: A Warrior of the Light values a child’s eyes because they\nare able to look at the world without bitterness. When he wants to\nfind out if the person beside him is worthy of his trust, he tries to see\nhim as a child would.”\n“What is a Warrior of the Light?”\n“You already know that,” she replied with a smile. “He is someone\ncapable of understanding the miracle of life, of fighting to the last for\nsomething he believes in—and of hearing the bells that the waves\nset ringing on the seabed.”\nHe had never thought of himself as a Warrior of the Light. The\nwoman seemed to read his thoughts. “Everyone is capable of these\nthings. And, though no one thinks of himself as a Warrior of the\nLight, we all are.”\nHe looked at the blank pages in the notebook. The woman smiled\nagain.\n“Write about the Warrior,” she said.\n\n"

His own life\nhas in many ways been as varied and unusual as the protagonists of\nhis internationally acclaimed novels. Like them, Paulo Coelho has\nfollowed a dream in a quest for fulfillment. His own dream, to be a\nwriter, met with frustration throughout much of his early adult life, a\ntime in which he worked at various professions, some of them\nmaterially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling. “I always knew,” he\nsays, “that my Personal Legend, to use a term from alchemy, was to\nwrite.” He was thirty-eight when he published his first book.\nIn 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him, he traveled\nthrough much of South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe.\nReturning to Brazil after two years, he began a successful career as\na popular songwriter. In 1974, he was imprisoned for a short time by\nthe military dictatorship then ruling in Brazil. In 1980, he experienced\none of the defining moments of his life: he walked the five hundred–\nplus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.\nOn this ancient highway, used for centuries by pilgrims from France\nto get to the cathedral said to house the remains of St. James, he\n\n"
