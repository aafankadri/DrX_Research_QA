    "text": "\nThe Plan of the Giza Pyramids \n \n1 \n \nThe Plan of the Giza Pyramids \nby John A.R. Legon \nRevision Date:   22-11-2019 \nMy initial findings on the Giza Site Plan of Three Pyramids were first briefly summarized in a \npamphlet  published by the Archaeology Society of Staten Island in 1979.1  Subsequently, I \ndescribed the most significant features of the integrated site plan in several articles in the journals \nDiscussions in Egyptology2 and Göttinger Miszellen.3  Further research has shown that many \nmore factors must be taken into account, without alterating the basic framework of the dimensions \nin royal cubits which I described in 1979. The following text is  based on my article in Discussions \nin Egyptology Vol. 10, but now includes much new material and new illustrations.  In addition, \nacount has been taken of the extensive survey work carried out since 2012 by the late Glen Dash, \nand the positions of the corners of the three pyramids have been placed in the coordinate system \ninitiated by Mark Lehner and David Goodman for the Giza Plateau Mapping Project. \nNow that a detailed topographical study of the Giza Plateau is in progress, 4 it is interesting to \nconsider the results of the excavations and survey carried out by Flinders Petrie in 1880-2, when \nthe exact dimensions and relative positions of the pyramids of Khufu, Khaefre and Menkaure, \nwere established by triangulation..5 With reference to Petrie's survey-data, the present paper \nreviews the evidence first put forward by the writer in 1979, 6 showing that the sizes and relative \npositions of the three pyramids were determined by a single unifying ground plan.  \n                                                 \n1 J.A.R.

    "text": "\nThe Plan of the Giza Pyramids \n \n2 \n \nThe existence of a dimensional scheme underlying the placing of the three pyramids is suggested \nin the first instance by the very regular arrangement of these pyramids on the Giza plateau. As a \nresult, the sides of the bases and the distances that separate them define consecutive axial distances \nfrom north to south and from east to west. The three pyramids were accurately aligned with respect \nto the four cardinal points, and were displaced from one another in a configuration which satisfies \nthe requirements of a coherent dimensional design. Certain technical difficulties relating to the site \nchosen for each pyramid in turn also suggest that there must have been some significant constraint, \nin addition to factors such as ease of construction or the selection of the most favourable \narchitectural setting, which determined where each of the three pyramids was positioned. \n \nUsing some of the finest surveying equipment available in his day, Petrie asserted that he had fixed \nthe positions of the main stations in his triangulation to within 3 mm.7 The accuracy of his work is \nproven by the fact that his result for the mean side-length of the Great Pyramid differs from the \nvalue obtained in the meticulous survey carried out by J.H. Cole in 1925,8 by only 1.5 cm,  even \nthough nearly all of the outer casing of the pyramid is missing. Whereas Petrie had located single \npoints of the casing in pits near the centre of each side, excavations in preparation for the work by \nCole showed that substantial traces of the original casing-edge still remained on the pavement in \nsome places where the casing itself has been destroyed. \n                                                 \n7  Petrie, op.cit., 24. \n8 .J-H..Cole, The determination of the exact size and orientation of the Great Pyramid of Giza, (Survey of Egypt, \npaper no.39), (Cairo, 1925). \n\n"

The Third Pyramid, however, differs in azimuth from the \nSecond and Great Pyramids by about 1/3 degree in a clockwise direction, so that elements of about \n25 cm are generated at the corners relative to the mean components of spacing.

The dimensions would thus have been measured out from the north-eastern area of the \nplateau, southwards and westwards towards the Second and Third Pyramids. The task of setting \nout the plan would have been no more difficult in principle than laying out the base of a single \npyramid, and it will be noted that the components of spacing between the three pyramids are in \neach case shorter than the side-length of the Great Pyramid. \nBefore the extensive quarrying of the rock for building stone took  place, the natural \nsurface of the Giza plateau had a general slope of around 5 degrees, and the projection onto \nthe horizontal plane of a measurement taken over the surface would have been reduced by \nabout 0.4%. Thus the dimensions of the site plan could have been laid out with reasonable  \naccuracy without correcting for the slope of the plateau. Once the approximate position for \neach pyramid had been determined, however, the sites were leveled around the perimeter, \nand may also have been connected by temporary horizontal-topped embankments so that \nthe east-west and north-south components of spacing between the three pyramid bases \ncould be laid down with the greatest accuracy. While ropes may have been used in the \ninitial marking out of the site plan, the observed accuracy in the finished dimensions was \nprobably achieved  through the use of pairs of butting measuring rods laid alternately end \nover end – a method capable of achieving a high degree of precision.16 \n \nThe Great Pyramid \nIt is generally accepted that the sides of the Great Pyramid measure 440 cubits, although \nonly the longest or south side has exactly this length according to the survey by Cole.17  In \nterms of the Giza royal cubit of 0.52375 metres or 20.620 inches, the actual mean side of \n230.364 metres corresponds to 439.8 cubits, with an average variation in the sides of only 6 \ncm or 0.1 cubit.

    "text": "\nThe Plan of the Giza Pyramids \n \n7 \nthe Great Pyramid. Taking further distances along the north-south axis, the impression of a \ndeliberate design is strongly supported. The distance southwards from the north side of the \nGreat Pyramid to the south side of the Second Pyramid is 1101 cubits, or only 0.1% greater \nthan the round-figure of 1100 cubits. This is just 2½ times the side of the Great Pyramid of \n440 cubits, and the south sides of the two pyramids are separated by an axial distance from \nnorth to south of about 3/2 × 440 or 660 cubits.  \nFrom these plausible formative dimensions of 440 and 250 cubits, we can now obtain a \nprovisional design-value for the side-length of the Second Pyramid as follows: \n \nNominal  Side-length of Second Pyramid = 440 × 3/2 - 250 = 410 cubits \n \nI have termed this the nominal side-length of the Second Pyramid, because Petrie's survey-\ndata gives an actual mean side of of 8474.9 inches or exactly 411 cubits. The average \nvariation in the sides from their mean length is only 1.5 inches or 4 cm. Thus although the \nabove derivation accounts for a dimension of about 410 cubits in preference to one of just \n400 cubits, an adjustment of one cubit appears to have been made to the actual side-length. \nReasons for this adjustment will be given shortly. \nNow taking dimensions along the east-west axis, Petrie's data places the west side of the \nSecond Pyramid 624 cubits westwards from the west side of the Great Pyramid. Again with \nan adjustment of one cubit, therefore, this dimension may be equated with a nominal value of \n2½ × 250 or 625 cubits, making it analogous to the distance of 2½ × 440 or 1100 cubits along \nthe north-south axis. Hence the side-length of the Second Pyramid and the position relative to \nthe Great Pyramid may be ascribed to a simple design based upon modules of 440 and 250 \n\n"

It is in fact only necessary to draw in the diagonal of the enclosing rectangle on a \nplan of √2 : √3 to obtain a point of intersection with the opposing diagonal of the initial square \non a plan of 1 : 1.

The question therefore arises as to why \nthe east-west overall dimension diverges from the value of 1000√2 or 1414.2 cubits by \nabout three cubits. That this is not an error is initially indicated by the fact that the axial \ncomponent of 353.5 cubits westwards from the Second Pyramid to the west side of the \nThird Pyramid has the value of 250√2 cubits:  \n250√2 = 353.55... cubits \nThus this dimension is accurately one-quarter of the ideal overall dimension on the same \naxis. It is the length of the diagonal in the modular layout squares of 250 cubits, which define \nthe north-south spacing between the Second and Great Pyramids and the dimension of about \n2½ × 250 or 625 cubits on the east-west axis. Adding this element of 353.5 cubits  to the \ndistances as already defined in our initial modular scheme along the east-west axis gives an \noverall east-west dimension of (440 + 625 + 353.5) equals 1418.5 cubits, which is more than \n4 cubits greater than the value of 1000√2 cubits. Thus the subtraction of one cubit from the \ncomponent of 2½ × 250 or 625 cubits may be seen as a judicious adjustment which improved \nthe accuracy of the square-root value in the overall dimension, without unduly undermining \nthe integrity of the modular scheme. This adjustment, furthermore, was balanced by the \naddition of one cubit to the modular dimension of 2½ × 440 or 1100 cubits, to satisfy the    \nfundamental division of the overall dimension at the south side of the Second Pyramid. \nThe mathematical import"

The evidence for the usage of these pyramids \nas tombs by certain kings of the Fourth Dynasty, on the other hand, is secondary and superficial, \nand could be explained by the appropriation of pre-existing monuments. The Giza layout provides \ncompelling evidence in support of the claim which is made in the Osirian Scripts,20 to the effect \nthat the three pyramids were constructed as a centre for the initiation of priest-neophytes into the \noccult wisdom of ancient Egypt, some thousands of years before the founding of the historical \nFirst Dynasty. \n \nNeedless to say, the notion that the Giza pyramids and temples could predate the Fourth Dynasty is \nunlikely to find many supporters in orthodox circles, but is nonetheless worthy of consideration in \nthe view of the present writer.. The fact that the name of Khufu is found written on the internal \nmasonry of the Great Pyramid in no way invalidates this possibility, since it is obvious that a king \nwho wished to claim ownership of the monument would have been obliged to adopt the name of \nthe original builder as his own, in order to avoid the need to erase the name from the fabric of the \npyramid  – an  impossible task. \n \nThe historical Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty would not, however, have wanted to be remembered as \nthe appropriator of the Great Pyramid, but rather as the builder, and to this end it is conceivable \nthat he required the population of Egypt to contribute stones towards its construction. Garbled \nreferences to this state of affairs may be found in the history of Herodotus, who tells us that Khufu \nplunged into all manner of wickedness.  He closed the temples, forbade the Egyptians from \nmaking offerings to the gods, and instead compelled them to labour one and all in his service.21  \nHe  raised money by prostituting his own daughter, who being bent on leaving a monument which \nwould perpetuate her own memory, required each man to make her a present of a stone towards the \nworks which she contemplated..
