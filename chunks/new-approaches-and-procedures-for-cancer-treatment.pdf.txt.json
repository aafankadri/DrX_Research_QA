Treating cancer has been a highly complex \nprocess. Conventional treatment approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have been in use, while \nsignificant advances are being made in recent times, including stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, ablation therapy, \nnanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis-based therapy. \nCurrent methods in oncology focus on the development of safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Stem cell therapy has \nbrought promising efficacy in regenerating and repairing diseased or damaged tissues by targeting both primary and metastatic \ncancer foci, and nanoparticles brought new diagnostic and therapeutic options. Targeted therapy possessed breakthrough \npotential inhibiting the growth and spread of specific cancer cells, causing less damage to healthy cells. Ablation therapy \nhas emerged as a minimally invasive procedure that burns or freezes cancers without the need for open surgery. Natural \nantioxidants demonstrated potential tracking down free radicals and neutralizing their harmful effects thereby treating or \npreventing cancer. Several new technologies are currently under research in clinical trials, and some of them have already \nbeen approved.

In this era worldwide, over half of all ongoing \nmedical treatment trials are focusing on cancer treatments.7 \nEntities, such as the type of cancer, its site, and severity, guide \nto select treatment options and its progress. The most widely \nused traditional treatment methods are surgery, chemotherapy, \nand radiotherapy, while modern modalities include hormone \ntherapy, anti-angiogenic, stem cell therapies, immunotherapy, \nand dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.10\nConventional cancer therapies\nThe most recommended conventional cancer treatment strat-\negies include surgical resection of the tumors followed by \nradiotherapy with x-rays and/or chemotherapy.11 Of these \nmodalities, surgery is most effective at an early stage of dis-\nease progression. Radiation therapy can damage healthy \ncells, organs, and tissues. Although chemotherapy has \nreduced morbidity and mortality, virtually all chemothera-\npeutic agents damage healthy cells, especially rapidly divid-\ning and growing cells.12 Drug resistance, a major problem \nwith chemotherapy, is a phenomenon wherein cancer cells \nthat initially were suppressed by an anti-cancer drug develop \nresistance to the drug.

    "text": " the licensed list of stem cell therapies.\nTargeted drug therapy\nTargeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances \nwhich are sometimes interchangeably used as “molecularly \ntargeted drugs,” “molecularly targeted therapies,” and “pre-\ncision medicines.” Those drugs’ mechanism of action is by \ninterfering with growth molecules which leads to blocking \nthe growth and spreading of cancer.34 Tumor initiation and \nprogression are determined by the TM of an atypical tumor \nwhich comprises endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle \ncells, fibroblasts, various inflammatory cells, dendritic cells, \nand CSCs. There are various signaling mechanisms and \npathways that TM-forming cells dynamically interact with \nthe cancerous cells which are suitable for sustaining a rea-\nsonably high cellular proliferation. So, it is the area of \nresearch interest using TM conditions to mediate effective \ntargeting measures for cancer therapy.35\nSelectively treating cancer cells with conventional chem-\notherapy is difficult since it is similar to normal cells. So \nthose problems are intervened by cellular mechanisms, such \nas cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, proliferation pre-\nvention, and interfering with metabolic reprogramming by \ntargeted drug therapy agents.36 Modifying TM and targeting \nTM for drug delivery for effective treatment are two strate-\ngies that can be used for the treatment of cancer.37 Targeted \ntherapy drugs do work in different ways from standard \nchemotherapy drugs treatment like attacking cancer cells \nwhile doing less damage to normal cells which is a program-\nming that sets them apart from normal, healthy cells.38\nUsing targeted therapy markedly increased the survival \nrate for some diseases, for example, from 17% to 24% in \npatients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the addition of \nerlotinib to standard chemotherapy. Imatinib has had a dra-\nmatic effect on chronic myeloid leukemia, and rituximab, \nsunitinib, and trastuzumab have revolutionized the treatment \nof renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer, respectively.39\nWe can classify the targeted cell agents based on the \nmechanism of their work or their target site.

Similar to surgery, thermal ablation \nremoves the tumor and a 5–10 mm thick margin of seem-\ningly normal tissue but the tissue is killed in situ and then \nabsorbed by the body later. The procedure is similar to sur-\ngery using an open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic approach \nbut is commonly applied using a percutaneous or non-inva-\nsive approach. The type of tumor, site, physician’s choice, \nand health status determine the approach.51\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, \nhigh-intensity focused ultrasound, and cryoablation are cur-\nrently being used in the clinical setting.

Compounds, such \nas vitamins, alkaloids, flavonoids, carotenoids, curcumin, \nberberine, quercetin, and others, are examples of natural \nantioxidants screened in vitro and in vivo.79\nLimited bioavailability and/ or toxicity is one of the chal-\nlenges of natural drugs while their translation into clinical \npractice.47 Curcumin has cytotoxic effects in different kinds \nof tumors, such as the brain, lung, leukemia, pancreatic, and \nhepatocellular carcinoma,80 while sparing normal cells at \neffective therapeutic doses. The curcumin’s biological prop-\nerties, treatment duration and efficient therapeutic doses are \nunder study.80 This day, about 27 clinical trials are done, \nwhile 40 are under study on curcumin.\nBerberine is an alkaloid compound that has been studied \nto be effective against different cancers as a chemopreven-\ntive agent, modulating many signaling pathways. Different \nnanotechnological strategies have been developed to facili-\ntate its delivery across cell membranes due to their poorly \nsoluble in water.81 Six clinical trials are under study and two \nhave been completed.\nQuercetin is another natural plant origin agent that is \neffective alone and also in combination with chemotherapeu-\ntic agents in treating many cancers, such as lung, prostate, \nliver, colon, and breast cancers.82 Quercetin’s mechanism of \naction is by binding to cellular receptors and the interference \nof several signaling pathways.83 Currently, six clinical trials \nare under study and seven studies have been completed.\nCurrent clinical trials\nIn recent years, analysis of cancer medication has taken out-\nstanding steps toward more practical, precise, and fewer \ninvasive cancer treatments in the research of clinical trials \n(Figure 1"

Table 3 summarizes the poten-\ntial advantages and disadvantages of the new treatment \napproaches.\nTable 4 summarizes the approaches to advanced cancer \ntherapies and their respective delivery systems with examples.\nConclusion\nCurrent methods in oncology focus on the development of \nsafe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Targeted medical \ncare helped rising the biodistribution of recent or already \ntested chemotherapeutical agents around the specific tissue \nto be treated; different methods, such as sequence medical \ncare, siRNAs delivery, therapy, and inhibitor molecules, sup-\nply new potentialities to cancer patients. Gene therapy acts \nby direct in situ insertion of exogenous genes into benign \ntumors. Noticeably, stem cells can be used as regenerative \nmedicine, therapeutic carriers, drug targeting, and generation \nof immune cells because of having unique biological actions \non other cells.22 On the opposite hand, thermal ablation and \nmagnetic hyperthermia are promising alternatives to the \ngrowth surgical process. Finally, radionics and pathomics \napproaches facilitate the management of huge knowledge \nsets from cancer patients to enhance prognosis and out-\ncomes.
